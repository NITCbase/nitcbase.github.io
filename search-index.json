Its only field is blockNum. The field blockNum stores the disk block number corresponding to the block object. The block has to be loaded and stored in one of the 32 buffers of the StaticBuffer class before its data can be accessed. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the block, once loaded, may not even be present in the buffer memory later on because of the buffer replacement algorithm implemented by Buffer Layer. In order to work with data of the block, any method of the BlockBuffer class or its descendent classes need to know the address of the buffer memory to which the block has been loaded. Hence any method of this class operating on the block data should first get the pointer to the buffer memory that holds the contents of the block. The loadBlockAndGetBufferPtr() method is used for this purpose. The public methods of BlockBuffer deal with information like header and block type, which are generic to all blocks. RecBuffer and IndBuffer classes extend the class BlockBuffer, thereby, inheriting all the fields and methods of BlockBuffer. Note If the class definition of a class (say A) declares another class (say B) as a friend class, then an instance of class B can access the private fields and methods of class A. This friendship is, however, not inherited by the child classes of B. As per the NITCbase design, the definition of the class StaticBuffer contains the declaration: friend class BlockBuffer. Hence, the methods in BlockBuffer can access the private fields and methods of the class StaticBuffer. On the other hand, RecBuffer and IndBuffer classes can access them only through the public functions of StaticBuffer class and through the public and protected functions of BlockBuffer class. class BlockBuffer{ public: //methods BlockBuffer(char blockType); BlockBuffer(int blockNum); int getBlockNum(); int getHeader(struct HeadInfo* head); int setHeader(struct HeadInfo* head); void releaseBlock(); protected: //field int blockNum; //methods unsigned char *getBufferPtr(); int getBlock(); int getFreeBlock(int blockType); int setBlockType(int blockType); }; The following are the specifications for the methods in class BlockBuffer.","s":"class BlockBuffer","u":"/docs/Design/Buffer Layer/BlockBuffer","h":"","p":43},{"i":46,"t":"Description​ One of theConstructors of the class BlockBuffer Called if a new block of the input type is to be allocated in the disk. note If the block has already been initialised as a record or index block, use constructor 2.

A large pool of memory (called buffer in the documentation) is pre-allocated and managed to hold copies of disk blocks in the primary memory. When a request involving access/update of a disk block comes from any of the higher layers, the corresponding disk block is loaded into the buffer. After performing updates, the block is committed back to the disk from the buffer. NITCbase uses a dedicated Buffer Layer for the above functionality. All the requests involving disk blocks go through the Buffer Layer. The interface provided by the Buffer Layer gives a memory address space abstraction to the higher layers, hiding the complexities involved in the reads and writes to the actual physical disk blocks. NITCbase has pre-allocated memory for holding 32 disk blocks in its buffer memory at a given time. Buffer Layer is responsible for maintaining the buffer memory and making replacements and writebacks as required. The disk class functions are used by the Buffer Layer to load blocks from the disk to the buffer and also to write back blocks as and when necessary. A single object of the disk class needs to be declared at the start of the session. Its purpose is to run the constructor and the destructor of the class. Note The Disk class constructor will create a new Run Copy of the actual disk and all disk accesses during runtime of NITCbase is done via this Run Copy. At the close of the system, the Disk class destructor will write back the Run Copy of disk to the actual disk. NITCbase follows an Object-Oriented design for Buffer Layer. The class diagram is as shown below. Various structures used in the buffer layer are outlined in the below diagrams. Certain other structure definitions and functions that help access record data and metadata from the disk block are also included in the Buffer Layer.

Whenever such a selective access request is made, the method in the Buffer Layer implementing the access functionality will pack the requested data into the corresponding block structure designed to store that particular type of data.

Buffer blocks will be committed back to the disk as and when required. In addition to storing the data of a block, class StaticBuffer also maintains meta-information for each loaded block in an array of BufferMetaInfo structures through the metaInfo[BUFFER_CAPACITY] field. StaticBuffer class also maintains a copy of the Block Allocation Map in its blockAllocMap[DISK_BLOCKS] field.

This class provides the basic disk fetch and commit interfaces to the higher layers, creating an illusion of having the entire disk in memory at all times. StaticBuffer is a static class, i.e., all member fields and methods are declared static. By doing so, memory will be allocated statically for all member fields of the class, and any access to them will refer to the same statically allocated memory.

This allows all methods in BlockBuffer to access the private fields and methods of the StaticBuffer class.

These are loaded into the cache by the OpenRelTable constructor at the start of the session. These relations remain in the cache memory throughout the session and can only be closed by the OpenRelTable destructor during shutdown. The class contains a private member field, attrCache, which is an array of pointers to struct AttrCacheEntry with size MAX_OPEN. For each relation opened, an entry is made in the array attrCache, at the index given by relation id of the relation. This entry is the head of the linked list of struct AttrCacheEntry elements. A linked list is used because a relation can have variable number of attributes (though the maximum number of attributes for a relation is bounded in Nitcbase by 125 - why?). Each element in the linked list corresponds to an attribute of the relation. The class provides public overloaded methods - getAttrCatEntry() and setAttrCatEntry() to retrieve and update the Attribute Catalog entry of a relation's attribute in the Attribute Cache Table. The class also provides overloaded public methods - getSearchIndex() and setSearchIndex() for retrieving and updating the searchIndex field of Attribute Cache Entry.

The Cache Layer, thus, provides an interface for catalog access to the higher layers by hiding the storage and maintenance details of the catalogs. Cache Layer can cache a maximum of MAX_OPEN number of relations at any given time. NITCbase requires that the relation be first loaded to cache memory before any operation is performed on it. Three tables are used by NITCbase for caching Catalogs - the Relation Cache Table for Relation Catalog entries, the Attribute Cache Table for Attribute Catalog entries and the Open Relation Table to keep track of the entries stored in the other two catalogs.

The public getRelId() method of the OpenRelTable returns the relation id of the input relation name. The class OpenRelTable contains as its private member field - tableMetaInfo, an array of struct OpenRelTableMetaInfo that stores the meta information of the entries of the table. The OpenRelTable allows MAX_OPEN number of entries in the cache at any given time.

These relations remain in cache memory throughout the session and can be closed only during shutdown. The OpenRelTable constructor initializes the tableMetaInfo field and populates the Relation Cache Table and Attribute Cache Table with entries of both Relation Catalog relation and Attribute Catalog relation. The OpenRelTable destructor closes any open relation remaining, including the Relation Catalog and Attribute Catalog relations, when the system is shut down. The public openRel() and public closeRel() functions are used to open and close an entry in the Open Relation Table respectively.

The first two entries of the Relation Cache Table corresponding to RELCAT_RELID and ATTRCAT_RELID are reserved for storing the entries of Relation Catalog relation and Attribute Catalog relation, respectively. These are loaded into the cache by the OpenRelTable constructor at the start of the session. These relations remain in the cache memory throughout the session and can only be closed by the OpenRelTable destructor during shutdown. The class contains a private member field, relCache, which is an array of pointers to struct RelCacheEntry with size MAX_OPEN. For each relation opened, an entry is made in the array relCache, at the index corresponding to the relation id of the relation. This entry points to the struct RelCacheEntry that stores all the attribute values of the relation's entry from the Relation Catalog block along with other meta-data of the relation. The class provides public methods - getRelCatEntry() and setRelCatEntry() to retrieve and update the Relation Catalog Entry of a relation in the Relation Cache Table. The class also provides public methods getSearchIndex() and setSearchIndex() for retrieving and updating the searchIndex field of Relation Cache Entry. The private method recordToRelCatEntry() is used to convert a record (implemented as an array of union Attribute) to RelCatEntry structure. This function is called by the friend class, OpenRelTable, while opening a relation. Similarly, the private method relCatEntryToRecord() is used to convert RelCatEntry structure to a record. This function is also called from the friend class, OpenRelTable, while closing a relation. C++ Static Classes RelCacheTable is a static class, that is, all member fields and methods are declared static. Memory is allocated statically for all member fields of the class. This static methods in this class is used to access its static member fields. C++ allows static methods to be accessed using the semantics class_name :: function_name(). note The class OpenRelTable is a friend class to the RelCacheTable class.

The DBMS must store relations in the disk and the strategy is to store each relation in a set of blocks in the disk, organized as a linked list. Each block in such a linked list will be called a record block. The block will contain some metadata as well, for instance, the indices of the left block and right blocks in the linked list. Records in a relation are composed of fields known as attributes, each of which contains one item of information. NITCbase fixes the size of attribute as 16 bytes, but the records of a relation can be of variable size - varying from 16 bytes (for a record with single attribute) to the size of the larget record that can fit into a block. A record block stores the actual data records. In addition to data records, some metadata is also stored in the preamble/header of each block. The following figure shows the record block structure for a relation with K attributes. Let L be the number of records stored in a block (given K, L can be determined, which is explained later.). Since each attribute requires 16 bytes of storage space, to store each record of this relation 16 * K bytes must be allocated. note In real-world database systems, the size of an attribute will vary depending on the type of the attribute. For instance, an integer type attribute will require less storage space than a string type attribute. In NITCbase, we fix the size of all attributes to the same value to simplify the implementation. It is a conceptually straightforward (but cumbersome from the point of implementation) task to modify the DBMS to support variable-sized attributes. First four bytes (0-3) of header are used to identify the type of block (REC / IND_INTERNAL / IND_LEAF) where REC represents a record block. Next four bytes (4-7) are used for storing parent block pointer, which has no significance for a record block and can be set to -1. Bytes 8-11 and 12-15 are used for storing left and right block numbers respectively. Next four bytes are used for storing the number of records currently stored in the block. Bytes 20-23 and 24-27 are used for storing #Attr (Number of attributes of the records of the relation that are stored in this block) and #Slots (Number of slots in this block) respectively. Bytes 28-31 are reserved for future use. Each record block is divided into slots of variable record size. Each slot stores a single record (and hence requires 16 * K bytes for a relation with K attributes). Each block can have an arbitrary number of slots depending on the number of attributes in the relation. Number of slots (Maximum number of records, L) that fits in a block for any given relation can be calculated as: 32+L+L∗(16∗K)≤2048L∗(16∗K+1)≤2016#Slots=L=⌊2016((16∗#Attributes(K))+1)⌋32+L+L*(16*K) \\leq 2048 \\\\ L*(16*K + 1 ) \\leq 2016 \\\\ \\#Slots = L = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {2016} {((16 * \\#Attributes(K)) + 1)} \\right \\rfloor32+L+L∗(16∗K)≤2048L∗(16∗K+1)≤2016#Slots=L=⌊((16∗#Attributes(K))+1)2016​⌋ The slotmap, which appears at the end of the header is used for indicating whether a slot is occupied or free. Size of the slotmap is equal to the number of slots, L, that fits in the block. If a slot is free, its corresponding entry in slotmap will be SLOT_UNOCCUPIED or else it will be SLOT_OCCUPIED. Slotmap starts from byte 32 of the header followed by slots which store the actual records. Some amount of space may be left unused at the end whose size is less than the size of a record. The record block must be loaded from the disk to the main memory before its data can be accessed/modified. The Buffer Layer provides the necessary data structures for this purpose. The RecBuffer class is used to access a record block. The header of the block is stored in the struct HeadInfo. Each record in a record block is treated as an array of union Attributes. Question 1 Q1. Calculate the number of slots and slotmap size for a relation with 5 attributes.

Question 2 Q2. What is the maximum number of attributes possible for a relation in NITCbase? View solution In NITCbase, size of the record in any relation is bounded by the size of a block. Hence the number of attributes is maximum when a record fits in a block. It is calculated as: 16∗K+1≤2016K=⌊201516⌋K=12516*K+1 \\leq 2016 \\\\ K = \\left \\lfloor \\frac{2015}{16} \\right \\rfloor \\\\ K = 125 \\\\16∗K+1≤2016K=⌊162015​⌋K=125 Question 3 Q3. What is the maximum number of slots possible for a record block in NITCbase? View solution A record block has the maximum number of slots when number of attributes of the corresponding relation is 1.

The DBMS may maintain zero or more indices per relation. There are two types of nodes for a B+ tree. These are called internal nodes and leaf nodes. A disk block that stores an internal node of the B+ tree is called an Internal Index block. Each internal index block in NITCbase stores a maximum of 100 attribute(key) values. Each of these values has an associated pair of left and right child pointers. Hence each internal index block is also required to store 101 child pointers (Only 101 child pointers are required because the right child of one value is the same as the left child of the next value). An Internal index block is divided into two parts. The first 32 bytes stores header followed by actual attribute(key) values and child pointers arranged alternatively as shown in the figure. The header metadata is similar to that of a record block. The first four bytes of the header stores the value INDINT. PBlock is the block number of parent block in the corresponding B+ tree. LBlock and RBlock have no significance for an internal index block. #Entries field stores the actual number of attribute values (of maximum 100) stored in the block. #Attrs and #Slots fields also have no significance for an internal index block.

The size of an index in NITCbase is 32 bytes (the last 8 bytes are unused) Any Leaf Index Block is also divided into a header part of 32 bytes followed by a part containing actual indices. The header is similar to that of any other block. The first four bytes of the header stores the value INDLEAF. PBlock is the block number of the parent block in the corresponding B+ tree. This entry must always contain block number of an Internal Index block.

For example to do linear search on the relation catalog where relation name matches a particular relaiton name, you must provide the attribute name argument as \"RelName\" / RELCAT_ATTR_RELNAME constant. RelName (bytes 0-15) stores the name of the relation, #Attributes (bytes 16-31) stores the number of attributes of that relation, and #Records (bytes 32-47) stores the number of records currently stored in that relation. The record blocks of a relation are arranged as a linked list. FirstBlock (bytes 48-63), which stores the block number of the first record block of the relation, essentially points to the head of the linked list. LastBlock (bytes 64-79), which stores the block number of the last record block of the relation, indicates the tail of the linked list. #Slots (bytes 80-95) stores the number of slots a record block of that relation has.

For example to do linear search on the attribute catalog where attribute name matches a particular attrbute name, you must provide the attribute name argument as \"AttributeName\" / ATTRCAT_ATTR_ATTRIBUTE_NAME constant. RelName is the name of the relation corresponding to the attribute, AttributeName is the name of the attribute and AttributeType is the data type of the attribute. Only two data types are permitted in NITCbase- numbers (NUM) and strings (STR) of maximum length 16. The PrimaryFlag is presently unused *. NITCbase employes B+ tree for indexing. RootBlock stores the root block number of the B+ tree if there is an index created on the attribute; and contains -1 otherwise. Offset is an integer that specifies the relative offset of the attribute in the record (0 for the first attribute, 1 for the second attribute and so on). * At present, NITCbase does not support the notion of a primary key. The flag is kept in the slot for future support of primary keys. note Attribute Catalog is internally implemented as a relation.

The key to achieve this lies in the choice of a suitable underlying data structure that defines the structure of index in the disk. NITCbase uses the B+ tree data structure for indexing. We all are aware of how easy it is to locate a page or a topic in a book if you have an index. We can say that accessing each record in a database is also very easy when you have an index structure for the same. Creating an index is basically creating a data structure that holds an attribute value and a pointer to a record block on the disk, i.e. a 'key-pointer' pair. Once we generate an index for a relation, we can store it on the disk so that, each time one needs to access the records, they can do so by searching these index blocks. The advantage of indexing is that records can be fetched from the disk with fewer disk accesses. We'll see how this is possible now.","s":"B+ Trees","u":"/docs/Misc/B+ Trees","h":"","p":312},{"i":315,"t":"For an exhaustive search on a linearly structured index like an array, the time required for disk accesses is of complexity O(n), where n is the number of blocks that store the index. In the case of a binary search tree, the time required for the search of any entry in the array is reduced to log2nlog_2 nlog2​n. The number of entries in each node of a BST is restricted to 1. Suppose we can increase this number and can introduce more branches to a single node, then the height of the tree as well as the number of accesses decreases. Such a tree is called the m-way search tree. Suppose you have 2 entries on a single node, then it can have at most 3 child nodes. For, eg: This is known as a 3-way search tree with 2 keys. The order of a tree is the maximum number of children that a node in a tree can have. For a multi-way search tree of order m, each node can have a maximum of m children and m-1 entries. The entries in each node are sorted. Similar to a BST, all the entries in the left subtree of a node will have a key lesser than the parent's key value. All the entries in the right subtree will be greater than it. How can we connect this to the database and relation? Assume each node of the tree to be a list of pairs containing an attribute value and a pointer to the record that contains that particular attribute value on the disk. The height of the tree will determine the number of disk accesses required in the worst case. Each node in the tree can be stored as an index block in the disk. The disadvantage of m-way search trees is that they are unbalanced. i.e. every path from the root node to a leaf node is not of the same length. Since there are no rules for insertion of elements into an m-way search tree, it could be skewed to one side, i.e. every node could fall on one side which would increase the time complexity of search from log(n) to O(n) in the worst case. B Trees and B+ Trees are self-balancing m-way search trees confined to specific insertion and deletion rules such that every root-to-leaf path is of the same length. The properties of a B Tree with order m are : In a B tree, there are two kinds of nodes: leaf nodes and internal(non-leaf) nodes. Every internal node has at most m children. An internal node with k children contains k-1 entries. Each entry in an internal node is (left child pointer, key value, record pointer, right child pointer) where key value is the attribute value, record pointer points to the corresponding record in the disk and the left child pointer and right child pointer point to the respective child nodes. Each entry in a leaf node is (key value, record pointer). The key value of an entry is greater than those of all the elements in it's left child and is lesser than those of all the entries in it's right child. All leaf nodes appear on the same level. This is because when a node is full, we split them into two such that each node is always at least half full. The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node. The creation of a B Tree is bottom-up. We can visualize the tree as a multi-level index. The bottom layer can be considered the first level indexing, the layer above it as the second level indexing, so on. Consider a table of 9 records that need to be indexed by a particular attribute. Let’s use a B-tree of order 4. If the attribute values corresponding to each record are inserted, we get a B Tree as shown below. Entries : 15, 20, 22, 30, 33, 45, 10, 53, 28. R1-R9 are the record pointers pointing to the records corresponding to each entry on its left. C1-C3 are the pointers to each of the child nodes from the internal node. As you can see, a record pointer is present at every entry. This is a disadvantage because it reduces the number of entries that can be stored in a single node. It also increases the number of levels in the tree thereby increasing the complexity of the search. A solution to this problem is B+ Tree.","s":"Indexing Data Structures","u":"/docs/Misc/B+ Trees","h":"#indexing-data-structures","p":312},{"i":317,"t":"A B+ Tree is fundamentally a B-Tree, having some additional properties. The distinguishing features of a B+ Tree from a B Tree are: In a B+ Tree, the internal node does not store record pointers. Each leaf node entry in a B+ Tree is (key value, record pointer) similar to a B Tree. Each entry in an internal node of B+ Tree is (left child pointer, key value, right child pointer). Here, record pointers are stored only in leaf nodes in contrast to a B Tree where it is stored in both leaf nodes and internal nodes. This allows more keys to be stored in internal nodes in a given amount of memory, thereby reducing the height of the tree. In a B+ Tree, all the keys appear in the leaf nodes, unlike a B Tree. In a B Tree, when a node is full (regardless of being a leaf node or internal node), the node is split and the middle entry is moved to the parent node. However, in a B+ Tree, when a leaf node becomes full and is split, the middle entry is stored in both the parent node and the leaf node. In the case of a split in the internal node, the middle entry is stored only in the parent similar to B Tree. So, all keys appear in leaf nodes and all leaf nodes appear on the same level. As all paths from the root node to a leaf node are the same length, the tree is said to be balanced. A balanced tree guarantees that the number of disk accesses required to fetch any record is equal because all the paths from the root to the leaf nodes are the same length. Search is quicker in a B+ Tree The leaf nodes of B+ trees are maintained as a linked list maintaining key values in sorted order, so doing a linear scan of all keys will require just one pass through all the leaf nodes. A B tree, on the other hand, would require a traversal of every level in the tree. This property aids us in the process of fetching records. For example, consider a query to fetch records with a particular attribute value greater than X. At first, we traverse down the tree, starting from the root, to find the first key value in the leaf node that succeeds in satisfying our search condition and fetch that record using its record pointer. Since the keys are maintained in a sorted linked list manner, we can linearly scan further from our first success point. Question Q. How many keys can be stored in an internal block of a B Tree and B+ Tree? (Block size: 1024 bytes, Record and Child pointer: 6 bytes) View solution B Tree:- An entry in an internal node can be considered as a set of a key, record pointer, and child pointer. Hence its size is 22 bytes (10+6+6). We also have an additional child pointer(recall that k entries will have k+1 children). Hence number of entries n can be calculated as. 22n+6=1024n=⌊101822⌋=4622n + 6 = 1024 \\\\ n = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {1018} {22} \\right \\rfloor = 4622n+6=1024n=⌊221018​⌋=46 B+ Tree:- An entry in an internal node can have a key and a child pointer. This accounts for 16 bytes (10+6). Then, we have the additional child pointer. Hence the number of entries n can be calculated as 16n+6=1024n=⌊101816⌋=6316n + 6 = 1024 \\\\ n = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {1018} {16} \\right \\rfloor = 6316n+6=1024n=⌊161018​⌋=63 We can see that more keys can be stored in a B+ Tree than in a B Tree. This becomes a huge difference as the block size and record pointer size increases. The above B Tree, when converted to a B+ Tree will look something like this. As discussed earlier, each of the entries in the B+ Tree corresponds to a particular attribute value in the relation.","s":"B+ Tree","u":"/docs/Misc/B+ Trees","h":"#b-tree","p":312},{"i":319,"t":"The purpose of using the B+ tree data structure is to optimise the search process. Let us see how this is done. Algorithm​ Suppose we want to find a node with key k. Start from the root node. Compare k with each of the keys in the root node until we find an entry with key > k. If we find such a node, we move to the left child of that entry. If not, then we move to the rightmost child of the node. We keep repeating this process until we reach a leaf node. We can do a linear search on the leaf node to find our key and the corresponding value. Example​ How do we traverse a B+ tree? Let us consider the following B+ tree. Suppose we want to find all values greater than 25. We start with the root node. The first value is 40. Since 25 < 40. We move to the left child. We compare 25 to 10, 20. Since 25 is greater than both of them, we move to the rightmost child of the node. Now, we're at a leaf node. On searching through the values we get a hit for 25. Since our search query is > 25, we move to the next entry. Recall that all the leaf nodes of the b+ tree are connected in a linked list. So, we can traverse towards the right starting from 40 to obtain our answer {40, 40, 45, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75}.","s":"Search in a B+ Tree","u":"/docs/Misc/B+ Trees","h":"#search-in-a-b-tree","p":312},{"i":321,"t":"Let's consider a B+ tree with 4 keys in each internal node and a maximum of 3 keys in a leaf node. Every insertion guarantees that all the entries are in sorted order in the linked list created by the leaf nodes. A concise algorithm for the insertion of a single entry is given below. Algorithm​ Firstly, we traverse down the tree as mentioned earlier from the root node to find the leaf node where our new entry is to be inserted. If the leaf node is not full, add the entry. Otherwise, split the leaf node. Allocate new leaf and move half the elements of current leaf node to the new leaf node. Insert a copy of the current leaf node's largest key(i.e. the middle key before split) into the parent. If the parent is full, split it too. Add the middle key to its parent node. Repeat until a parent is found that need not be split. Example​ Let’s understand B+ Tree creation and insertion using the following data. 10, 5, 75, 20, 55, 60, 65, 15, 40, 70, 45, 25, 40 For inserting any new entry, first, we traverse the B+ Tree from its root node and find its position in the corresponding leaf node. If the leaf node can accommodate the new entry, it is inserted without much thought. As there is no tree initially, the first entry is inserted into a leaf node. Similarly, the rest of the insertion takes place until the leaf node is full. Maintain a sorted order in every node. Let's insert : 10, 5, and 75. This leaf node is now the root node of the B+ Tree. Next, we must insert 20 into it. As you can see the leaf node is full. Hence we must create a new leaf node and redistribute the keys. Sort the entries (5, 10, 20, 75) and insert the first half (2 entries i.e. 5 and 10) in the previous leaf node followed by the second half (i.e. 20 and 75) in the new leaf node. The last entry of the first leaf node is stored in the internal node as the first entry whose left child points to the older leaf node and right child points to the new leaf node. This new internal node is the root node of the tree. You may see that a copy of the internal entries is always stored in the left child of the entry. Thus all the entries on its left child will be less than or equal to it as well as all the entries in its right child will be greater than it. Now let’s insert 55 into the above created B+ Tree. Always remember that insertion happens only in the leaf nodes. The first step is to find the child node from the root node where the new entry will belong. Here 55 is greater than 10, hence we check the right child of 10. Since we have reached the leaf node we can insert the new entry if there is a vacant slot. Here we can insert 55 between 20 and 75. The next entry to be inserted is 60. Traversing down the tree from the root node, 60 is to be inserted in the right child of 10 i.e. leaf node containing 20, 55, 75. The leaf node is full hence we must split this into 2 leaf nodes and update the internal node. As explained above we can see 20 and 55 remain in the previous leaf node and 60 and 75 are stored in the new leaf node. 55 becomes the new entry to the internal node. The next entry to be inserted is 65. Traversing down the tree from the root node, we can infer that 65 must be inserted in the right child of 55. In that leaf node, we have to insert 65 between 60 and 75. Since the leaf node is not full, we can directly insert 65. The next insertion is of entry 15. At a single glance, we can see a vacant slot after 10. But we cannot insert 15 there. On traversing down the tree from the root node, 15 must be inserted in the child node between 10 and 55. The said node is not full hence 15 can be inserted directly. Next, we have to insert 40. Consider the root node. 40 must be inserted in the leaf node between 10 and 55. Since this leaf node is full, split the leaf node into 2 and distribute the 4 entries (15, 20, 40, 55) as explained before into these leaf nodes. Now the new entry to the internal node is 20. Since the internal node has vacant slots, we can insert 20 into it. We must make sure that the entries in internal nodes are also in sorted order. The next entry is 70. The new entry is greater than all the entries in the root node. Hence it must be inserted in the child node after 55. But the node is already full. Let’s split this node, insert the entries (60, 65, 70, 75) and update the parent node accordingly. We must insert 45 next. It must be inserted in the child node between 20 and 55. Here we can directly insert 45 between 40 and 55. The new entry is 25. At the root node, we infer it must be inserted in the child node between 20 and 55. This leaf node is already full. Hence must be split in order to accommodate 25. 25 and 40 remain in the leaf node. 45 and 55 are written to a new node. 40 is the new entry to the internal node. Here we can see that the internal node is full. Therefore it must be split into 2 internal nodes and use another internal node as a parent to both these nodes. Sort all the internal node entries along with the new entry (10, 20, 40, 55, 65). Entries before the middle entry (10 and 20) are written back to the first (old) internal node whereas entries after the middle entry (55 and 65) are written to the 2nd (new) internal node. Make sure that the pointers to child nodes are updated correspondingly. The middle entry 40 becomes the first entry to the parent internal node. Next insertion is again 40. 40 is equal to the entry in the root node, and it is greater than all the entries in its left child. Hence we get the required leaf node which contains 25 and 40. Since the leaf node is not full, 40 is inserted into it.","s":"Insertion in a B+ Tree","u":"/docs/Misc/B+ Trees","h":"#insertion-in-a-b-tree","p":312},{"i":324,"t":"A debugger is a program that runs other programs, allowing the user to exercise control over these programs, and to examine variables when problems arise.

Disk access is a high-latency operation. Therefore, as the size of relation increases, searching records that satisfy certain conditions by accessing every record in the disk blocks, can adversely affect the performance. This necessitates indexing.","s":"Introduction","u":"/docs/Misc/Indexing","h":"#introduction","p":329},{"i":333,"t":"Creating an index on an attribute of a relation is basically creating a data structure that holds the attribute value and a pointer to the records. It enables us to speed up the retrieval of records in response to certain search conditions on the attribute value. An index in a database is very much like the index in a book. And, just as a book's index points to locations within the book, a database's index points to records within the disk. The database organizes the indices such that these pointer values can be found extremely fast. And, once the database has located the desired set of pointer values, it can then turn around and quickly read the full record. In the end, a database index is a means to locate and read table data as quickly as possible. The objective of creating an index on an (attribute, relation) pair, is to make search operation on a relation for records with attribute value that satisfy a search condition, faster than linear search on the blocks of the file. If n is the number of records in a file, the time required to search based on an attribute is only O(log n) whereas it would take O(n) time for a linear search in the absence of an index. Creating an index itself is an expensive operation requiring O(n) time and space. Hence indices are normally created only on those attributes on which frequent queries are performed on in the database. As index is a collection of attribute values and their corresponding record pointers, the structure of the index plays a key role in determining how fast the index can be accessed and the kind of queries that can be processed. Perhaps one of the most common types of index structures is the B+ Tree. It is a self-balancing, sorted variation on the binary tree structure that stores the index values in a relatively shallow but wide shape. NITCbase uses B+ Tree for indexing records.","s":"Understanding Indexing","u":"/docs/Misc/Indexing","h":"#understanding-indexing","p":329},{"i":335,"t":"PREREQUISITE READING B+ Trees Physical Layer Each internal index block in NITCbase stores a maximum of 100 attribute values. Each of these values has an associated pair of left and right child pointers. Since the right child of one value is the same as the left child of the next value each internal index block stores 101 child pointers. Each index stored in the leaf block is a 3-tuple occupying 32 bytes(attribute value-16 bytes, block number-4 bytes, slot number-4 bytes and 8 bytes of unused space). A leaf index block stores 63 entries. Let us understand indexing in NITCbase with an example. Question 1 Q1. Consider a relation of 10 attributes(Attribute_1, Attribute_2,....., Attribute_10) containing 12,000 records. We need to process a query to fetch records with the value of Attribute_2 greater than X. Compare the number of disk accesses required in the presence and absence of an index on Attribute_2. View solution The record block size is 2048 bytes. Number of slots (Maximum number of records, L) that fits in a block for the given relation can be calculated as: #Slots=L=⌊2016((16∗#Attributes(K))+1)⌋=⌊2016(16∗10+1)⌋=12\\#Slots = L = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {2016} {((16 * \\#Attributes(K)) + 1)} \\right \\rfloor \\\\ = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {2016} {(16 * 10 + 1)} \\right \\rfloor = 12#Slots=L=⌊((16∗#Attributes(K))+1)2016​⌋=⌊(16∗10+1)2016​⌋=12 Therefore, the number of record blocks required to store the given relation is: #RecordBlocks=⌈1200012⌉=1000\\#Record Blocks = \\left \\lceil \\frac {12000} {12} \\right \\rceil = 1000#RecordBlocks=⌈1212000​⌉=1000 To process our search query in the absence of an index, we need to fetch all the records from disk blocks one by one, and check if they satisfy our search condition (Attribute_2 > X). This implies that the number of disk accesses required to process a query in the absence of an index is 1000. Suppose, an index is created on Attribute_2 of this relation. In NITCbase, the maximum number of entries in an internal index block and leaf index block are 100 and 63 respectively. When an index block is full, it is split into two, i.e a new index block is allocated such that each of them is atleast half full. So, if there is more than one internal index block and leaf index block, the minimum number of entries in an internal index block and leaf index block are 50 and 32 respectively. We know that all the attribute values along with their record pointers appear in any of the leaf blocks. So the maximum number of leaf index blocks is: #LeafIndexBlocks=⌈1200032⌉=375\\#Leaf Index Blocks = \\left \\lceil \\frac {12000} {32} \\right \\rceil = 375#LeafIndexBlocks=⌈3212000​⌉=375 Given that the minimum number of internal index block entries is 50, the minimum number of children is 51. Therefore, the maximum height of the B+ Tree is : Height=⌈log⁡51375⌉=2Height = \\left \\lceil \\log_{51} {375} \\right \\rceil = 2Height=⌈log51​375⌉=2 While traversing down the tree from the root, we access 2 index blocks in the disk (including the leaf index block). The final leaf index block gives us the record-id i.e(block number, slot number) of the record required. We fetch the record from that record block using the record-id. So, the total number of disk accesses required when an index is created is, 2+1= 3. We notice that from 1000 disk accesses to 3 disk accesses, the performance increase is substantial. Now, let us understand the creation of B+ Tree in NITCbase in detail, and Insert and Search operations on it. PLEASE NOTE Going forward, we will be assuming simpler values than the actual sizes of NITCbase in the interest of easier understanding. We will be taking the size of a record block as 320 bytes analogous to the 2048 bytes in NITCbase. Therefore, keeping all other factors the same, the number of slots per block would be 4. #Slots=L=⌊320−32((16∗#Attributes(K))+1)⌋=⌊288((16∗4+1)⌋=4\\#Slots = L = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {320 - 32} {((16 * \\#Attributes(K)) + 1)} \\right \\rfloor \\\\ = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {288} {((16 * 4 + 1)} \\right \\rfloor = 4#Slots=L=⌊((16∗#Attributes(K))+1)320−32​⌋=⌊((16∗4+1)288​⌋=4 Additionally, we will be taking the maximum number of entries in aninternal index block to be 4 and leaf index block to be 3. Consider a Relation Student (Name, Roll No, Batch, Marks) with 4 attributes. An index is to be created on the attribute Roll No. The records of the relation are as follows. (Name, Roll No, Batch, Marks) (A, 1, B, 95) (B, 3, A, 75) (C, 8, A, 87) (D, 7, A, 63) (E, 6, B, 59) (F, 4, B, 85) (G, 11, A, 52) (H, 13, B, 73) (I, 10, A, 72) (J, 9, B, 76) (K, 5, B, 90) (L, 12, A, 71) (M, 14, B, 69) (N, 2, B, 77) We have 14 records. Hence, the number of record blocks required can be found as below. #RecordBlocks=⌈144⌉=4\\#RecordBlocks = \\left \\lceil \\frac {14} {4} \\right \\rceil = 4#RecordBlocks=⌈414​⌉=4 The record block structure is as follows.","s":"B+Tree Implementation in NITCbase","u":"/docs/Misc/Indexing","h":"#btree-implementation-in-nitcbase","p":329},{"i":337,"t":"As discussed in the Physical Layer, each attribute catalog entry contains the RootBlock field which stores the root block number of the B+ Tree if there is an index created on the attribute or -1 otherwise.

Then, we iteratively insert all the values from the record into the index. We will cover the insertion algorithm next.","s":"Create Index","u":"/docs/Misc/Indexing","h":"#create-index","p":329},{"i":339,"t":"Considering the simplified version of B+ Tree implementation similar to NITCbase, the algorithmic procedure for insertion is given below: Algorithm:​ Find the correct leaf index block, say X, where the key value has to be inserted by traversing down the tree starting from the root block. Create a temporary array of indices containing entries of X. Insert the entry corresponding to the key value in the array maintaining sorted order. If the size of indices array<=3 on insertion, i.e leaf is not full, overwrite the leaf index block X with entries of the array. If the size of indices array=4, i.e leaf is full, get a new free leaf index block, say Y. Distribute the entries in indices array evenly between X and Y. X contains the first two entries. Y contains the next 2 entries. We must add a new entry to the parent block, say P with child pointers to X and Y. The last value of X is to be added to P (P=parent of X). If X does not have a parent block: Get a new free internal index block, i.e P, and insert the new entry. This is the case when the root is split. P is the new root block. Update the attribute catalog entry accordingly. Else Insert the new entry in P using a temporary array of indices containing entries of P, maintaining sorted order. If the size of indices array=5 on insertion of new entry, get a new free internal index block, say Q. Insert the first and last 2 entries in P and Q respectively. Also, insert the middle entry in the parent block above with child pointers to P and Q (Why? to propagate key values up the tree) by repeating the algorithm from step 2.ii.a (X=P, P=parent block of P). We need to insert the following entries, a set of key values of the attribute RollNo along with their corresponding record pointers i.e record-id(Block number, Slot number) in a sequential manner. (Attribute Value,(Block#, Slot#)) (1, (7, 0)) (3, (7, 1)) (8, (7, 2)) (7, (7, 3)) (6, (8, 0)) (4, (8, 1)) (11, (8, 2)) (13, (8, 3)) (10, (9, 0)) (9, (9, 1)) (5, (9, 2)) (12, (9, 3)) (14, (10, 0)) (2, (10, 1)) Before the first entry insertion is performed in a B+ tree, the attribute catalog entry is obtained from the attribute cache and the root block number of the attribute is checked. If it is not -1, we proceed further. The first entry will always be a leaf entry. Insert 1, 3, 8​ When 1 is to be inserted, a temporary array of indices containing the entry is created. The purpose of the array is to ensure all the entries are in sorted order. Since the size of the array is less than three, we rewrite the entries of the leaf index block in the sorted order from the array. The header of the block will be updated. Similarly, 3 and 8 are inserted. The parent block (PBlock) value remains -1 throughout these insertions as there is no parent block introduced in the B+ tree yet. Insert 7​ When the entry 7 is to be inserted, the entries are sorted in the array. However, it cannot be inserted or written into the same block L1 as now the existing leaf block has 3 entries i.e the leaf block is full. A new leaf block, L2 is hence obtained. Iterate through all the sorted four entries. L1 is overwritten by the first two entries (the first half of the entries) of current block L1 and the next two entries are written into the new leaf block, L2. The headers of both the blocks are updated to incorporate the changes. The RBlock value of L1 is set as L2 and the LBlock value of L2 is set as L1. This is to maintain a linked list of leaf blocks. A parent block is now required since there has been a split. A new internal index block, I1 is obtained for the same. The last value of the first block obtained on splitting the node, in this example the value 3 is made the entry of the internal index block. This does not violate the requirement that the maximum number of entries in an internal index block is four. The left child and right child of this new internal index block are set as L1 and L2 respectively. The parent block value of the child blocks is updated as I1. The attribute catalog will be updated with the changes including the new root block number. Insert 6​ When 6 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block, I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 6 is greater than 3, we traverse down to the right child of I1. As seen previously, the entries are sorted and since the maximum number of entries in a leaf block is not violated, the entries including the new entry 6 are written back into the block L2 and the number of entries in the header of L2 is updated. Insert 4​ When 4 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 4 is greater than 3, we traverse down to the right child of I1. The entries are sorted. However, in this case, the number of entries in the leaf block will become greater than three if the entry 4 is to be included in L2. Hence a new leaf block, L3 is introduced. L2 is overwritten with the first half of the sorted entries in the array [4,6] and the rest [7,8] are written into L3. The LBlock and RBlock values of the blocks are updated to maintain the linked list. Since L2 already has a parent block I1 and the number of entries in the parent block is less than four, the last value in the current L2 is the new entry to the parent block. The parent block entries are then sorted and written back into I1. The number of entries in I1 is incremented. The left child and right child of the new entry 6 in the parent block are set as L2 and L3 respectively. The parent block of L3 is set as I1. Insert 11​ When 11 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 11 is greater than 6, we traverse down to the right child of 6 in I1. The entries in L3 and the new entry 11 are sorted. Since the maximum number of entries in a leaf block is not violated, the entries are written back into the block L3 and the number of entries in the header of L3 is updated. Insert 13​ When 13 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 13 is greater than 6, we traverse down to the right child of 6 in I1. The entries are sorted. However, in this case, the number of entries in the leaf block L3 will become greater than three if the entry 13 is to be included. Hence a new leaf block, L4 is introduced. L3 is overwritten with the first half of the sorted entries in the array [7,8] and the rest [11,13] are written into L4. The LBlock and RBlock values of the headers of the blocks are updated to maintain the linked list. Since L3 already has a parent block I1 and the number of entries in the parent block is less than four, the last value in the current L3 is the new entry to the parent block. This new entry along with the current entries in I1 are sorted. The sorted entries are then written back into I1 and the number of entries in I1 is incremented. The left child and right child of the entry 8 in the parent block are set as L3 and L4 respectively. The parent block of L4 is set as I1. Insert 10​ When 10 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 10 is greater than 8, we traverse down to the right child of 8 in I1. The entries in L4 along with the new entry 10 are sorted and since the maximum number of entries in a leaf block is not violated, the entries are written back into the block L4 and the number of entries in the header of L4 is updated. Insert 9​ When 9 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 9 is greater than 8, we traverse down to the right child of 8 in I1 which is L4. The entries are sorted. However, in this case, the number of entries in the leaf block L4 will become greater than three if the entry 9 is to be included. Hence, a new leaf block L5 is introduced. The first half of the sorted entries in the array [9,10] are set in the block L4 and the rest [11,13] are set in L5. The LBlock and RBlock values of the headers of the blocks are updated to maintain the linked list. Since L4 already had a parent block I1 and the number of entries in the parent block is less than four, we take the last value in the current L4 and the current entries in I1 into a temporary array for the purpose of sorting. The sorted entries are then written back into I1 and the number of entries in I1 is incremented. The left child and right child of the entry 10 in the parent block are set as L4 and L5 respectively. The parent block of L5 is set as I1. Insert 5​ When 5 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 5 is greater than 3 but less than 6, we traverse down to the left child of 6 in I1 which is L2. The entries in L2 along with the new entry 5 are sorted and since the maximum number of entries in a leaf block is not violated, the entries are written back into the block L2 and the number of entries in the header of L2 is updated. Insert 12​ When 12 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 12 is greater than 10, we traverse down to the right child of 10 in I1 which is L5. The entries in L5 along with the new entry 12 are sorted and since the maximum number of entries in a leaf block is not violated, the entries are written back into the block L5 and the number of entries value in the header of L5 is updated. Insert 14​ When 14 is to be inserted, we traverse down the tree starting from the root block I1 to find the appropriate leaf index block. Since 14 is greater than 10, we traverse down to the right child of 10 in I1 which is L5. The entries are sorted. However, in this case, the number of entries in the leaf block L5 will become greater than three if the entry 14 is to be included. Hence a new leaf block, L6 is introduced. L5 is overwritten by the first half of the sorted entries in the array [11,12] and the rest [13,14] are written into L6. The LBlock and RBlock values of the blocks are updated to maintain the linked list. L5 already has a parent block I1. The last value in L5 and the current entries in I1 are sorted. However, block I1 has reached the maximum number of entries possible in an internal index block i.e the parent block is full. Hence we obtain a new internal index block, I2. We copy the first two entries [3,6] from the sorted entries into the old internal block I1 and the last two entries [10,12] are copied into the new internal block I2. The #Entries attribute of these two blocks is updated and the PBlock attribute of both are kept the same i.e -1. Since the previous parent block has now been split, a new internal index block, I3 is introduced. The middle value (8) of the previous root which had been stored in a temporary variable is now inserted into I3. The left child and right child of 8 in I3 are set as I1 and I2 respectively. The number of entries in the new internal index block is incremented to 1. The parent block of I1 and I2 is set to I3. The RootBlock number of this B+ Tree in the attribute catalog is updated to the new root block number. Insert 2​ Entry 2 is inserted in a similar manner as demonstrated in the previous steps.","s":"Insertion in B+ Tree","u":"/docs/Misc/Indexing","h":"#insertion-in-b-tree","p":329},{"i":341,"t":"Search is done on attributes that are indexed to get a record hit based on certain search conditions given (i.e op, attrval). op represents one amongst the 6 relational operators(EQ, LE, LT, GE, GT, NE corresponds to equal, less than equal, less than, greater than equal, greater than, not equal operators respectively). attrval denotes the attribute value that is to be checked against the operator. The attribute cache provides the information on previous hit i.e index of the previous record that satisfied the search condition, and it is modified if a new record hit is encountered. record-id (block number, slot number) corresponding to the record satisfying search condition is returned. A concise algorithmic procedure for search on a B+ Tree implemented in NITCbase is given below. Algorithm:​ Get searchIndex from the attribute cache and store it in the variable sIndex. searchIndex stores the block number of the corresponding leaf index block and index number, which is the offset of the index in that block. It represents the previous hit in the leaf blocks, i.e the previous record that satisfied the search condition. This is used to take advantage the linked list structure of leaf blocks after the first hit. Reset the value of searchIndex in the attribute cache to (-1, -1). This will be set to the correct index-id if an entry satisfying op for given attrval is found in the course of the search. If sIndex is (-1, -1), i.e the search is done for the first time : Traverse down the tree starting from the root, to find the first record in the leaf block that satisfies the search condition. Set searchIndex in the attribute cache to this new index found in the leaf block. Return the record-id of the record that satisfied the search condition. If there is no record that satisfies the search condition, return (-1, -1) as the record-id. Else (A record satisfying search condition was already found): Set the variable block = sIndex.block and index = sIndex.slot + 1. If index exceeds the number of entries present in the leaf index block, update block to its right block and set index = 0. Scan the leaf blocks linearly until from the current (block, index) until you find a record that satisfies the search condition. Set searchIndex in the attribute cache to this new index found in the leaf block. Return the record-id of the record that satisfied the search condition. If blocknum reaches -1, it implies that all the leaf blocks have been scanned, and search is completed. Return (-1, -1) as the record-id. Let us try to understand the trace of a search query on the B+ Tree implemented by the series of insert operations in the above section. Consider a query to fetch the student records of all the students with RollNo >= 11. Here, the search condition represented in the form (op, attrval) is (GE, 11). At first we retrieve the value of searchIndex from the attribute cache and store it in the variable sIndex. Then, we reset the value of searchIndex in the attribute cache to (-1, -1). This will be set to the correct index id if a record satisfying our condition is found in course of the search. Since it is the first search, the value retrieved and stored earlier in sIndex would be invalid. Traverse down the tree starting from the root, to find the first record in the leaf block that satisfies the search condition (i.e. RollNo >= 11). First such record is that of student with roll number 11. Since this is the first entry in the Leaf Block L5, searchIndex in the attribute cache is set to this new index found, i.e (L5, 0). L5 is block number of the corresponding leaf index block and 0 is the offset of the index in that block. The record-id of this record that succeeded in satisfying the search condition, (Block# 8, Slot# 2) is returned. Now, we proceed to the second iteration of search. sIndex is updated with the new value retrieved from searchIndex field of attribute cache. searchIndex in the attribute cache is then reset to (-1, -1). Since, there has been a previous hit, i.e. a previous record that satisfied the search condition, sIndex would contain a valid search index. Set the variable block = sIndex.block and index = sIndex.slot + 1. Here, that would be block = L5 and index = 0+1 = 1 We linearly scan the leaf blocks from this point. As we begin, we get the next record that satisfies our search condition, the record with RollNo=12 which lies at the offset 1 in the Leaf Index Block L5. searchIndex in the attribute cache is set to this new index found, i.e (L5, 1) and the record-id (Block# 9, Slot# 3) is returned. Now, we proceed to the third iteration of search. sIndex is updated with the new value retrieved from searchIndex field of attribute cache. Then, searchIndex of attribute cache is reset to (-1, -1). sIndex would contain a valid search index as there has been a previous hit. i.e sIndex = (L5, 1) We set block = L5 and increment the index, i.e index = 1+1 = 2. From, the header of the Leaf Block L5, we observe that the number of entries is 2 which implies that the maximum value of offset possible is 1. So, update the block to its right block and set index = 0. Therefore, block = L6 and index = 0. As leaf blocks are scanned linearly from this block, we immediately get the next hit at RollNo 13. searchIndex field in the attribute cache is updated to this new index found (L6, 0). The record-id of the corresponding record (Block# 8, Slot# 3) is returned. On proceeding with the next iteration of Search, sIndex is updated with searchIndex field of attribute cache and then searchIndex is reset to (-1, -1). So, sIndex = (L6, 0) We set block = L6 and index = 0+1 = 1 On beginning linear scan from this point, we get a hit at RollNo 14. searchIndex field in the attribute cache is updated to (L6, 1) and the corresponding record-id (Block# 10, Slot# 0) is returned. We proceed onto the next iteration of search. sIndex is updated with the searchIndex field of attribute cache and searchIndex is reset to (-1, -1). So, searchIndex = (L6, 1) Set block = L6 and index = 1+1 = 2. Header of the block L6 indicates that number of entries is 2 and so the maximum value of offset possible is 1. So, update block to its right block and set index = 0. Since L6 is the last and rightmost leaf index block in our linked list, RBlock of L6 is -1. block = -1 This implies that all the leaf blocks have been scanned, and search is completed. Return (-1, -1) as the record-id to indicate this.","s":"Search on B+ Tree","u":"/docs/Misc/Indexing","h":"#search-on-b-tree","p":329},{"i":343,"t":"The recommended way to work on NITCbase is using a dedicated docker container.

A database management system is a software that allows us to easily store, organize and retrieve data. Databases can be classified into various types depending on the logical structure of data within them. Here, we will only be talking about relational databases. A relational database models data as rows and columns in a series of tables. Three key terms are used extensively in relational database models: relations, attributes, and domains. A relation is a table with columns and rows. The named columns of the relation are called attributes, and the domain is the set of values the attributes are allowed to take. A relation in a production database might consist of millions of rows (or records). These records spread across several blocks when stored in the disk. On developing a database of our own, it is essential that we have access to records stored in the disk without much time delay. Disk access is a high-latency operation. Therefore, as the size of relation increases, searching records that satisfy certain conditions by accessing every record in the disk blocks, can adversely affect the performance. This necessitates indexing. In essence, a relational database will contain a collection of records corresponding to many relations and a proportional number of indexes to facilitate searching and other operations on the database. There's also need for a data structure to store the schema and metadata of the relations stored in the database. In NITCbase, we have the relation catalog and attribute catalog for these purposes. We will get into the implementation details of all these parts as we go further into the roadmap.","s":"Stage 1 : Understanding the Disk Interface (2 hours)","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage01","h":"","p":372},{"i":375,"t":"In the previous stage, we created the disk.xfs file.

At the lowest level, our database will need to interface with the filesystem. Similar to how an OS would provide you with read/write functionalities in it's standard library, here too you are provided with an API to access the XFS disk. The Disk Class provides functions to read and write disk blocks. Read the section on Disk Class before proceeding further. An important thing to note about NITCbase is it's runtime disk. While NITCbase is running, all the disk operations are done on a copy of the disk. All the updates to the disk are only copied to the actual disk on successful termination of the program. This helps us to avoid issues where the actual disk is an indeterminate state due to runtime errors in the program. The Disk class has a constructor and destructor that is meant to be run on beginning and end of execution of the program respectively. These functions are responsible for copying to and from the runtime disk as mentioned earlier. We will be declaring a single instance of the disk at the very top of our program. The readBlock and writeBlock methods are static and can be accessed as Disk::readBlock().","s":"The Disk Class","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage01","h":"#the-disk-class","p":372},{"i":381,"t":"In this stage, we will try to use the provided Disk functions to do I/O operations on the disk. In your mynitcbase folder, you will find a main.c file. We will be editing this file to read and write from a random block on the disk. In the very first line of the main function, you will find a declaration of an instance of Disk class for reasons we mentioned earlier. The commented-out lines following this declaration are relevant only in later stages and will be covered in due time. As you read in Disk model, each block of the disk is 2048 bytes. The disk functions expect two arguments: a buffer of size 2048 bytes and the block number that we want to work with. These 2048 bytes of memory/disk will have to be managed by us. We know that in C/C++, an unsigned char is a type that can hold one byte and can hold a value between 0 and 255. So, we can declare the memory buffer for the disk block as this type. unsigned char buffer[BLOCK_SIZE]; //BLOCK_SIZE is a constant that has value 2048 Now, we can read into this buffer using the Disk::readBlock() function. Disk::readBlock(buffer, 7000); // 7000 is a random block number that's unused. Let's edit a few bytes of the buffer and write it back to the disk. We'll be using the memcpy function provided in the cstring header for this. The function takes three arguments; the destination pointer, the source pointer, and the number of bytes. It copies the required number of bytes from the source to the destination. char message[] = \"hello\"; memcpy(buffer + 20, message, 6); //Now, buffer[20] = 'h', buffer[21] = 'e' ... Disk::writeBlock(buffer, 7000); Now, our modified buffer has been written to the disk. Let's try reading this back from the disk into a new buffer to see if our changes have been made. unsigned char buffer2[BLOCK_SIZE]; char message2[6]; Disk::readBlock(buffer2, 7000); memcpy(message2, buffer2 + 20, 6); std::cout << message2; Additionally comment out the call to the handleFrontend function for now. We will be looking into it later. So, in summary, your main function should look like so. the modified main.c file int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { Disk disk_run; unsigned char buffer[BLOCK_SIZE]; Disk::readBlock(buffer, 7000); char message[] = \"hello\"; memcpy(buffer + 20, message, 6); Disk::writeBlock(buffer, 7000); unsigned char buffer2[BLOCK_SIZE]; char message2[6]; Disk::readBlock(buffer2, 7000); memcpy(message2, buffer2 + 20, 6); std::cout << message2; return 0; } A Makefile has been provided to you with this project.

When we initially start adding entries to a database, we can obtain a random free disk block and start dumping the values into it one after another and we can traverse it just as easily. But, we are soon going to run out of space on the disk block. What will we do then? We'll get another random disk block and continue our process. But there's now a complication. How will we traverse between these two disk blocks while reading these entries. Clearly, we'll need to store the preceding and following disk block as some metadata in each block. You might've realized that this is in fact just a linked list and you're right. Records in NITCbase are stored in a linked list of disk blocks. Now, what exactly is a record? It is just an array of attribute values. Each relation can have a different number of attributes and the total number of records per disk block of a relation varies based on that. Each record block is divided into slots of variable record size and each slot stores a single record. So, now we have a lot of relations each having their own records stored on the disk across multiple blocks. How do we identify and organise these blocks? The relation catalog solves this problem in NITCbase. It stores the relation name, the number of attributes and other information related to the record blocks for all the relations in the database. We now have a provision to keep track of the list of relations that we have stored in the database. But we don't have any information regarding the attributes of each relation. In a production database, an attribute can be one of a myriad of possible types, but here in NITCbase, we'll restrict that to two possible types: NUM and STR. Numbers and strings, as the name would suggest. Both of these types are fixed at a size 16 bytes for the sake of simplicity. The attribute catalog stores these details of all the attributes of every relation in the database. It also stores details about indices created on attributes. We'll get into the details of indexing later. The relation catalog and attribute catalog together allows us to get all the relations and their respective schemas from our disk. If you didn't realise it yet, the relation and attribute catalog themselves are just relations on our disk! And as such, the blocks storing all the data we mentioned are just record blocks. The first entry of the relation catalog is that of the relation catalog itself. The second entry is for the attribute catalog. And the first entries in the attribute catalog are the attributes of the relation catalog and the attributes of itself. Recall the Disk Model where you read that the first few blocks are reserved for these data structures. Read the documentation for record blocks and catalog structures before proceeding further. Q. Consider the following catalog entries and record for a relation. Relation Catalog Entry RelName #Attrs #Records FirstBlock LastBlock #Slots Students ? ? 34 35 ?

Recall that the XFS interface already implements all the functionality of NITCbase. Switch to the XFS_Interface folder and run ./xfs-interface to access the prompt. Once in the prompt, we'll create a relation as follows $ ./xfs-interface # CREATE TABLE Students(RollNumber STR, Name STR, Marks NUM, Class STR) Relation Students created successfully # exit We can verify the schema of the relation by running the schema command in the XFS Interface # schema Students Relation: Students Attribute Type Index ---------------- ---- ----- RollNumber STR no Name STR no Marks NUM no Class STR no","s":"Creating Relations","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage02","h":"#creating-relations","p":384},{"i":391,"t":"We have some relations in our DBMS now. Let's try to implement a way to see all the relations we created. To see the details of a relation, we just need to read the records stored in the relation and attribute catalogs. How do we do that? A DIGRESSION WARNING: This section is a quick detour to give you an overall picture of the experiment before we start with building it. This section links to various pages of the documentation. You do not need to follow any of these at this stage and they are only provided for your information. Do not spend more than 15 minutes here. A proper DBMS consists will implement a large number of operations. Here, we are starting with the implementation of one of the most rudimentary features of a relational database; printing the details of the relations. Before we get into that, let us take a quick look at the architecture of our database. NITCbase follows a 7-layer object oriented architecture. In the course of this project, you will be implementing all these layers. They are described below. Algebra Layer: Handles the high level relational algebraic operations of our database Schema Layer: Handles the schema operations such as creation, deletion Block Access Layer: Handles high-level operations on the disk such as search and insert B+ Tree Layer: Handles all index related operations. Cache Layer: Handles caching of the relation and attribute catalog Buffer Layer: Handles buffered operations on all disk blocks Physical Layer: Provides the low-level operations on the disk blocks. We also have a frontend interface which is responsible for interacting with the user, receiving the commands, and translating them to the appropriate function in the Schema/Algebra layer. Most of this layer has already been implemented and provided to you. You will only need to make minor additions to this layer. Read the home page and architecture page if you have not done so already. Let's come back to the task of displaying the relations on the database. Since we want to handle the display of any number of relations, we need to be able to fetch the total number of relations on the disk. Where do we find this information? Recall that the header of each record block stores the number of entries in that block. Checking the header of the relation catalog block should give us this number. Once we have this value (let it be N), we can get the names of the relations by reading the records at the first N slots of the relation catalog block. We will be implementing a rudimentary version of the getHeader() and getRecord() function of the Buffer Layer to do these operations. A simplified class diagram with the functions we need to implement is shown below. The classes will eventually implement a lot of functionality of the Buffer Layer. In this section, we will only implement a subset of the methods of BlockBuffer and RecBuffer classes. NOTE: The functions are denoted with circles as follows. 🔵 -> methods that are already in their final state 🟢 -> methods that will attain their final state in this stage 🟠 -> methods that we will modify in this stage, and in subsequent stages We have two classes, BlockBuffer and RecBuffer. An object of either of those classes allows us to work with a particular disk block (stored in the blockNum member field). The BlockBuffer class implements the common operations available to all disk blocks. The RecBuffer class extends BlockBuffer to add functionality specific to a record block. We will implement the BlockBuffer::getHeader() and RecBuffer::getRecord() functions using the disk read and write operations that we covered in the previous stage. Note that these functions will assume that memory for its arguments has been already allocated by the calling function. We will also be making use of two data structures for representing the data. Read the documentation for struct HeadInfo and union Attribute before proceeding further. NOTE All commonly used values have already been defined as constants and can be used throughout your implementation. Let us edit our main.cpp to see a top-down view on how to use these functions for our goal of printing all the relations on our DBMS. main.cpp int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { Disk disk_run; // create objects for the relation catalog and attribute catalog RecBuffer relCatBuffer(RELCAT_BLOCK); RecBuffer attrCatBuffer(ATTRCAT_BLOCK); HeadInfo relCatHeader; HeadInfo attrCatHeader; // load the headers of both the blocks into relCatHeader and attrCatHeader. // (we will implement these functions later) relCatBuffer.getHeader(&relCatHeader); attrCatBuffer.getHeader(&attrCatHeader); for (/* i = 0 to total relation count */) { Attribute relCatRecord[RELCAT_NO_ATTRS]; // will store the record from the relation catalog relCatBuffer.getRecord(relCatRecord, i); printf(\"Relation: %s\\n\", relCatRecord[RELCAT_REL_NAME_INDEX].sVal); for (/* j = 0 to number of entries in the attribute catalog */) { // declare attrCatRecord and load the attribute catalog entry into it if (/* attribute catalog entry corresponds to the current relation */) { const char *attrType = attrCatRecord[ATTRCAT_ATTR_TYPE_INDEX].nVal == NUMBER ? \"NUM\" : \"STR\"; printf(\" %s: %s\\n\", /* get the attribute name */, attrType); } } printf(\"\\n\"); } return 0; } Now, let us implement the functions that we invoked from the main() function. Open the BlockAccess.cpp file in the Buffer folder and complete the following. Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp // the declarations for these functions can be found in \"BlockBuffer.h\" BlockBuffer::BlockBuffer(int blockNum) { // initialise this.blockNum with the argument } // calls the parent class constructor RecBuffer::RecBuffer(int blockNum) : BlockBuffer::BlockBuffer(blockNum) {} // load the block header into the argument pointer int BlockBuffer::getHeader(struct HeadInfo *head) { unsigned char buffer[BLOCK_SIZE]; // read the block at this.blockNum into the buffer // populate the numEntries, numAttrs and numSlots fields in *head memcpy(&head->numSlots, buffer + 24, 4); memcpy(&head->numEntries, /* fill this */, 4); memcpy(&head->numAttrs, /* fill this */, 4); memcpy(&head->rblock, /* fill this */, 4); memcpy(&head->lblock, /* fill this */, 4); return SUCCESS; } // load the record at slotNum into the argument pointer int RecBuffer::getRecord(union Attribute *rec, int slotNum) { struct HeadInfo head; // get the header using this.getHeader() function int attrCount = head.numAttrs; int slotCount = head.numSlots; // read the block at this.blockNum into a buffer /* record at slotNum will be at offset HEADER_SIZE + slotMapSize + (recordSize * slotNum) - each record will have size attrCount * ATTR_SIZE - slotMap will be of size slotCount */ int recordSize = attrCount * ATTR_SIZE; unsigned char *slotPointer = /* calculate buffer + offset */; // load the record into the rec data structure memcpy(rec, slotPointer, recordSize); return SUCCESS; } On compiling (run make) and executing this program, you should see the following output.

All subsequent operations on that block will be done on that buffer until that disk block is swapped out by a more recently required disk block. All the changes done to the buffer will be commited back to the disk at that point. This functionality is implemented as part of the Buffer Layer of NITCbase. However, in the present stage, we will not be implementing the write-back functionality. Here, we will modify our disk read operations to work from a buffer instead of the disk directly.

The StaticBuffer class has two member fields we are concerned about here. The blocks field is the actual buffer as we mentioned earlier. metainfo is an array of struct BufferMetaInfo which is used to store the metadata of the 32 (=BUFFER_CAPACITY) blocks that are in the buffer. At this stage, we'll use this structure to keep track of whether a buffer block is free or if it is storing a particular disk block. Both these arrays are static members of the class and hence need to be explicitly declared before they can be used. Buffer/StaticBuffer.cpp // the declarations for this class can be found at \"StaticBuffer.h\" unsigned char StaticBuffer::blocks[BUFFER_CAPACITY][BLOCK_SIZE]; struct BufferMetaInfo StaticBuffer::metainfo[BUFFER_CAPACITY]; StaticBuffer::StaticBuffer() { // initialise all blocks as free for (/*bufferIndex = 0 to BUFFER_CAPACITY-1*/) { metainfo[bufferIndex].free = true; } } /* At this stage, we are not writing back from the buffer to the disk since we are not modifying the buffer.

The only pending operation is to declare an instance of the class StaticBuffer in main() so that our constructor is called. Ensure that this declaration happens after the instance of the Disk class is declared. main.cpp int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { Disk disk_run; StaticBuffer buffer; // ... // ... } Compile the program and execute it.

Since this is such a common operation, NITCbase uses a more specialised data structure for operations on these structures. The Cache Layer handles the implementation of these structures. The relation cache and the attribute cache are specialised data structures used for accessing the catalogs. These caches are both arrays of size 12 (MAX_OPEN). Each entry in these arrays can store the catalog entries for a single relation. The entries in both the caches for a given index i < MAX_OPEN will correspond to the same relation. An entry of the relation cache stores the relation catalog entry, the rec-id (block & slot number) of the entry on the disk, and some other runtime data. An entry of the attribute cache is a linked list where each node contains one of the attribute catalog entries for the relation, the corresponding rec-ids and some runtime metadata. A relation which has it's entries stored in the caches is called open. We'll learn more about the open operation in later stages. Take a quick look at the documentation for relation cache table structures and attribute cache table structures before proceeding further. You don't need to understand any of the fields not mentioned here explicitly. The index corresponding to a relation in the relation/attribute cache is called it's relation id or rel-id. NITCbase fixes that the catalog entries for the relation catalog will always be stored at rel-id 0 (recall that the first relation in both the catalogs is the relation catalog). The catalog entries for the attribute catalog will always be stored at rel-id 1. At this stage, we will only be implementing the cache operations for these two relations.","s":"Caches","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage03","h":"#caches","p":394},{"i":405,"t":"The next feature that we will add to NITCbase is a rudimentary version of the relation and attribute cache. This functionality is implemented in the RelCacheTable, AttrCacheTable and OpenRelTable classes. The details of OpenRelTable are not relevant at this stage and will be covered in later stages. In this stage, we will only be using the constructor of this class to initialise our caches. The class diagram below shows the functions we will be implementing. A diagram showing the sequence of operations at system start is shown below. A NOTE ABOUT STATIC CLASSES A class is called static if all its member fields and functions are declared static. In the case of such classes, memory is allocated statically. Generally, static classes arise when only one instance of the class is required during run time. RelCacheTable, AttrCacheTable, OpenRelTable and StaticBuffer are examples of static classes. Generally, there is no need to create an instance of a static class (by defining a variable of the class) as the declaration of the class itself fixes the storage and access to the members and methods of the class. However, there is one exception to this rule. The exception arises when we wish to run a constructor and destructor for the class for initialization. In such cases, an instance of the class needs to be declared. OpenRelTable and StaticBuffer are examples of classes that require such instantiation. On the other hand, RelCacheTable and AttrCacheTable require no initializer code to run and hence, no instance variables are declared. Many of the classes encapsulating the implementation of higher layers of NITCbase are static classes that require no initializer code to run, and hence do not require instances to be created. We'll start by implementing RelCacheTable. Here, we have two functions; getRelCatEntry() which is used to the get the RelCatEntry from the relation cache and recordToRelCatEntry() which converts a record (array of union Attribute) to a RelCatEntry struct. We also need to declare the static member field relCache. Cache/RelCacheTable.cpp RelCacheEntry* RelCacheTable::relCache[MAX_OPEN]; /* Get the relation catalog entry for the relation with rel-id `relId` from the cache NOTE: this function expects the caller to allocate memory for `*relCatBuf` */ int RelCacheTable::getRelCatEntry(int relId, RelCatEntry* relCatBuf) { if (relId < 0 || relId >= MAX_OPEN) { return E_OUTOFBOUND; } // if there's no entry at the rel-id if (relCache[relId] == nullptr) { return E_RELNOTOPEN; } // copy the value to the relCatBuf argument *relCatBuf = relCache[relId]->relCatEntry; return SUCCESS; } /* Converts a relation catalog record to RelCatEntry struct We get the record as Attribute[] from the BlockBuffer.getRecord() function. This function will convert that to a struct RelCatEntry type. NOTE: this function expects the caller to allocate memory for `*relCatEntry` */ void RelCacheTable::recordToRelCatEntry(union Attribute record[RELCAT_NO_ATTRS], RelCatEntry* relCatEntry) { strcpy(relCatEntry->relName, record[RELCAT_REL_NAME_INDEX].sVal); relCatEntry->numAttrs = (int)record[RELCAT_NO_ATTRIBUTES_INDEX].nVal; /* fill the rest of the relCatEntry struct with the values at RELCAT_NO_RECORDS_INDEX, RELCAT_FIRST_BLOCK_INDEX, RELCAT_LAST_BLOCK_INDEX, RELCAT_NO_SLOTS_PER_BLOCK_INDEX */ } Similarly, in AttrCacheTable, we have a static member field attrCache and two functions; getAttrCatEntry() which is used to the get the AttrCatEntry from the attribute cache and recordToAttrCatEntry() which converts a record (array of union Attribute) to an AttrCatEntry struct. Note that an attribute cache entry is a linked list. The attribute cache is an array of linked lists. Cache/AttrCacheTable.cpp AttrCacheEntry* AttrCacheTable::attrCache[MAX_OPEN]; /* returns the attrOffset-th attribute for the relation corresponding to relId NOTE: this function expects the caller to allocate memory for `*attrCatBuf` */ int AttrCacheTable::getAttrCatEntry(int relId, int attrOffset, AttrCatEntry* attrCatBuf) { // check if 0 <= relId < MAX_OPEN and return E_OUTOFBOUND otherwise // check if attrCache[relId] == nullptr and return E_RELNOTOPEN if true // traverse the linked list of attribute cache entries for (AttrCacheEntry* entry = attrCache[relId]; entry != nullptr; entry = entry->next) { if (entry->attrCatEntry.offset == attrOffset) { // copy entry->attrCatEntry to *attrCatBuf and return SUCCESS; } } // there is no attribute at this offset return E_ATTRNOTEXIST; } /* Converts a attribute catalog record to AttrCatEntry struct We get the record as Attribute[] from the BlockBuffer.getRecord() function. This function will convert that to a struct AttrCatEntry type. */ void AttrCacheTable::recordToAttrCatEntry(union Attribute record[ATTRCAT_NO_ATTRS], AttrCatEntry* attrCatEntry) { strcpy(attrCatEntry->relName, record[ATTRCAT_REL_NAME_INDEX].sVal); // copy the rest of the fields in the record to the attrCacheEntry struct } Making use of the above defined functions, we can now modify our main.cpp file to fetch the catalog entries from the cache instead of the records. Additionally, we also declare an object of type OpenRelTable to invoke it's constructor. We'll implement this later. Ensure that the OpenRelTable object is declared after the Disk and StaticBuffer objects. main.cpp int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { Disk disk_run; StaticBuffer buffer; OpenRelTable cache; /* for i = 0 and i = 1 (i.e RELCAT_RELID and ATTRCAT_RELID) get the relation catalog entry using RelCacheTable::getRelCatEntry() printf(\"Relation: %s\\n\", relname); for j = 0 to numAttrs of the relation - 1 get the attribute catalog entry for (rel-id i, attribute offset j) in attrCatEntry using AttrCacheTable::getAttrCatEntry() printf(\" %s: %s\\n\", attrName, attrType); */ return 0; } You must now have an idea of the general flow of data between various functions. The only thing left to implement now is the constructor (and destructor) of class OpenRelTable. We'll use this constructor to read our RELCAT and ATTRIBUTECAT records from the disk into the cache. Recall that the index of a relation in the caches is called it's rel-id. The relation catalog has rel-id 0 (RELCAT_RELID) and the attribute catalog has rel-id 1(ATTRCAT_RELID). Cache/OpenRelTable.cpp OpenRelTable::OpenRelTable() { // initialize relCache and attrCache with nullptr for (int i = 0; i < MAX_OPEN; ++i) { RelCacheTable::relCache[i] = nullptr; AttrCacheTable::attrCache[i] = nullptr; } /************ Setting up Relation Cache entries ************/ // (we need to populate relation cache with entries for the relation catalog // and attribute catalog.) /**** setting up Relation Catalog relation in the Relation Cache Table****/ RecBuffer relCatBlock(RELCAT_BLOCK); Attribute relCatRecord[RELCAT_NO_ATTRS]; relCatBlock.getRecord(relCatRecord, RELCAT_SLOTNUM_FOR_RELCAT); struct RelCacheEntry relCacheEntry; RelCacheTable::recordToRelCatEntry(relCatRecord, &relCacheEntry.relCatEntry); relCacheEntry.recId.block = RELCAT_BLOCK; relCacheEntry.recId.slot = RELCAT_SLOTNUM_FOR_RELCAT; // allocate this on the heap because we want it to persist outside this function RelCacheTable::relCache[RELCAT_RELID] = (struct RelCacheEntry*)malloc(sizeof(RelCacheEntry)); *(RelCacheTable::relCache[RELCAT_RELID]) = relCacheEntry; /**** setting up Attribute Catalog relation in the Relation Cache Table ****/ // set up the relation cache entry for the attribute catalog similarly // from the record at RELCAT_SLOTNUM_FOR_ATTRCAT // set the value at RelCacheTable::relCache[ATTRCAT_RELID] /************ Setting up Attribute cache entries ************/ // (we need to populate attribute cache with entries for the relation catalog // and attribute catalog.) /**** setting up Relation Catalog relation in the Attribute Cache Table ****/ RecBuffer attrCatBlock(ATTRCAT_BLOCK); Attribute attrCatRecord[ATTRCAT_NO_ATTRS]; // iterate through all the attributes of the relation catalog and create a linked // list of AttrCacheEntry (slots 0 to 5) // for each of the entries, set // attrCacheEntry.recId.block = ATTRCAT_BLOCK; // attrCacheEntry.recId.slot = i (0 to 5) // and attrCacheEntry.next appropriately // NOTE: allocate each entry dynamically using malloc // set the next field in the last entry to nullptr AttrCacheTable::attrCache[RELCAT_RELID] = /* head of the linked list */; /**** setting up Attribute Catalog relation in the Attribute Cache Table ****/ // set up the attributes of the attribute cache similarly. // read slots 6-11 from attrCatBlock and initialise recId appropriately // set the value at AttrCacheTable::attrCache[ATTRCAT_RELID] } OpenRelTable::~OpenRelTable() { // free all the memory that you allocated in the constructor } And that's it; your NITCbase now uses buffers and caches!

This is also known as a selection operation in relational algebra. NITCbase supports selection with the following operators: =, !=, >, >=, < >=. We'll implement a function that will do the appropriate search and return to us a record that satisfies our condition each time it's called. Higher levels can call this function repeatedly until there are no more records to be found. You might've realized that the above function would require some global state to work as intended. We'll need to keep track of the previously found record so that we can fetch the next record that satisfies the condition. And that is exactly what the searchIndex field in the relation cache does. searchIndex in a relation cache entry stores the rec-id = {block, slot} of the last hit during linear search on that relation. A value of rec-id = {-1, -1} indicates that the search should start over from the beginning again. The search functionality is implemented in the Block Access Layer of NITCbase and made available to the user through the SELECT command. This command will be parsed and handled by the Frontend Interface which will call the Algebra Layer. The searchIndex field and it's operations will be implemented in the Cache Layer.","s":"The Search Operation","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage04","h":"#the-search-operation","p":408},{"i":415,"t":"A sequence diagrams documenting the flow of data between the layers is shown below.

Cache Layer Buffer Layer We will be working with the Frontend Interface from this stage onwards. For all subsequent stages, your main.cpp only needs to have declarations of Disk, StaticBuffer and OpenRelTable classes and a call to the handleFrontend() function as shown below. NOTE The handleFrontend() function runs in an infinite loop receiving commands from the user. Similar to the XFS Interface, graceful exit from the Frontend Interface is done using the exit command. In earlier stages, you had implemented the constructors for the StaticBuffer and OpenRelTable classes. In later stages, we will be implementing the destructors for these classes as well. The Disk class too has a destructor defined. It is essential that these destructors be run to ensure that all the changes we make during runtime are written back to the disk. The destructors will only be run if the program exits gracefully. If the program was to be killed with the Ctrl+C combination, the destructors will not be run and any changes made will be lost. Recall that all runtime changes in NITCbase are written to a temporary disk copy, and the changes are copied to the actual disk only at the time of program exit. main.cpp int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { Disk disk_run; StaticBuffer buffer; OpenRelTable cache; return FrontendInterface::handleFrontend(argc, argv); } As shown in the sequence diagram above, the Frontend User Interface will parse the SELECT command and call the Frontend::select_from_table() function in the Frontend Programming Interface. The actual select functionality is implemented in the Algebra Layer. Hence, the implementation of the Frontend::select_from_table() function only involves a call to the Algebra::select() function. NOTE In the current stage, we will only be implementing the handler for a command of the form SELECT * FROM RelName INTO TargetName WHERE Attribute `op` value; There are other versions of the SELECT command which map to different handlers as shown below: Frontend User Interface Command Frontend Programming Interface Handler SELECT Attribute1,Attribute2 FROM RelName INTO TargetName WHERE Attribute op value; Frontend::select_attrlist_from_where() SELECT * FROM RelName INTO TargetName; Frontend::select_from_table() SELECT Attribute1,Attribute2 FROM RelName INTO TargetName; Frontend::select_attrlist_from_table_where() Since we have only implemented the Frontend::select_from_table() function, the other commands do not currently do anything. Frontend/Frontend.cpp int Frontend::select_from_table_where(char relname_source[ATTR_SIZE], char relname_target[ATTR_SIZE], char attribute[ATTR_SIZE], int op, char value[ATTR_SIZE]) { return Algebra::select(relname_source, relname_target, attribute, op, value); } Before we can get into implementing search, we need to understand searchIndex and implement the associated functions in the Cache Layer. Each entry in the relation cache has a searchIndex field (see struct RelCatEntry). To start a search operation from the first record, we initialise this field with {-1, -1} with the RelCacheTable::resetSearchIndex() function. Once a linear search operation is executed and a record is found, we update searchIndex with the rec-id({block, slot}) of that record using RelCacheTable::setSearchIndex(). The next time linearSearch() is called, search will resume from this block until a successful block is found. The RelCacheTable defines methods to provide this functionality. Cache/RelCacheTable.cpp /* will return the searchIndex for the relation corresponding to `relId NOTE: this function expects the caller to allocate memory for `*searchIndex` */ int RelCacheTable::getSearchIndex(int relId, RecId* searchIndex) { // check if 0 <= relId < MAX_OPEN and return E_OUTOFBOUND otherwise // check if relCache[relId] == nullptr and return E_RELNOTOPEN if true // copy the searchIndex field of the Relation Cache entry corresponding // to input relId to the searchIndex variable. *searchIndex = relCache[relId]->searchIndex; return SUCCESS; } // sets the searchIndex for the relation corresponding to relId int RelCacheTable::setSearchIndex(int relId, RecId* searchIndex) { // check if 0 <= relId < MAX_OPEN and return E_OUTOFBOUND otherwise // check if relCache[relId] == nullptr and return E_RELNOTOPEN if true // update the searchIndex value in the relCache for the relId to the searchIndex argument return SUCCESS; } int RelCacheTable::resetSearchIndex(int relId) { // use setSearchIndex to set the search index to {-1, -1} } The SELECT command specifies a condition expecting to fetch all the records that satisfy the condition. While checking for this condition, we will need to have the details of the attribute which is part of the condition. In the previous stage, we had implemented the AttrCacheTable::getAttrCatEntry() function in the Cache Layer which returned to us the attribute at a particular offset. Here, we overload that function to find an attribute of a relation with a particular name. Cache/AttrCacheTable.cpp /* returns the attribute with name `attrName` for the relation corresponding to relId NOTE: this function expects the caller to allocate memory for `*attrCatBuf` */ int AttrCacheTable::getAttrCatEntry(int relId, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE], AttrCatEntry* attrCatBuf) { // check that relId is valid and corresponds to an open relation // iterate over the entries in the attribute cache and set attrCatBuf to the entry that // matches attrName // no attribute with name attrName for the relation return E_ATTRNOTEXIST; } One last thing we will need before implementing search is the ability to read the slotmap so that we can iterate through all the valid records of the relation. Let's add that function to our RecBuffer implementation in the Buffer Layer. Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp /* used to get the slotmap from a record block NOTE: this function expects the caller to allocate memory for `*slotMap` */ int RecBuffer::getSlotMap(unsigned char *slotMap) { unsigned char *bufferPtr; // get the starting address of the buffer containing the block using loadBlockAndGetBufferPtr(). int ret = loadBlockAndGetBufferPtr(&bufferPtr); if (ret != SUCCESS) { return ret; } struct HeadInfo head; // get the header of the block using getHeader() function int slotCount = /* number of slots in block from header */; // get a pointer to the beginning of the slotmap in memory by offsetting HEADER_SIZE unsigned char *slotMapInBuffer = bufferPtr + HEADER_SIZE; // copy the values from `slotMapInBuffer` to `slotMap` (size is `slotCount`) return SUCCESS; } Now, we finally implement linear search on our database. As mentioned earlier, NITCbase supports 6 operators in our search operation (=, !=, >, >=, < >=). An attribute in NITCbase can be either a string or a number. In case the attribute is a number, the operators work as you'd expect. If it is a string, the operation is performed with respect to lexicographic order (i.e > would be checked on the first differing letter between two strings). It would be convenient in our operation to abstract this implementation detail to a separate function. That is exactly what the compareAttrs function in Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp does. TASK: Implement the compareAttrs function in Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp before proceeding further. Now, we implement the BlockAccess::linearSearch() function in the Block Access Layer. BlockAccess/BlockAccess.cpp Implement the BlockAccess::linearSearch() function by looking at the algorithm given in the design docs. The last thing we need to do is to make use of the records that we get from BlockAccess::linearSearch() and print it to the console so that we can see it. This functionality is implemented in the Algebra::select() function in the Algebra Layer. In actuality, NITCbase only allows you to select records into another relation. But, at this stage we will ignore the target relation and just print the selected records onto the console. This will be modified later according to the actual specification. Algebra/Algebra.cpp /* used to select all the records that satisfy a condition. the arguments of the function are - srcRel - the source relation we want to select from - targetRel - the relation we want to select into. (ignore for now) - attr - the attribute that the condition is checking - op - the operator of the condition - strVal - the value that we want to compare against (represented as a string) */ int Algebra::select(char srcRel[ATTR_SIZE], char targetRel[ATTR_SIZE], char attr[ATTR_SIZE], int op, char strVal[ATTR_SIZE]) { int srcRelId = OpenRelTable::getRelId(srcRel); // we'll implement this later if (srcRelId == E_RELNOTOPEN) { return E_RELNOTOPEN; } AttrCatEntry attrCatEntry; // get the attribute catalog entry for attr, using AttrCacheTable::getAttrcatEntry() // return E_ATTRNOTEXIST if it returns the error /*** Convert strVal (string) to an attribute of data type NUMBER or STRING ***/ int type = attrCatEntry.attrType; Attribute attrVal; if (type == NUMBER) { if (isNumber(strVal)) { // the isNumber() function is implemented below attrVal.nVal = atof(strVal); } else { return E_ATTRTYPEMISMATCH; } } else if (type == STRING) { strcpy(attrVal.sVal, strVal); } /*** Selecting records from the source relation ***/ // Before calling the search function, reset the search to start from the first hit // using RelCacheTable::resetSearchIndex() RelCatEntry relCatEntry; // get relCatEntry using RelCacheTable::getRelCatEntry() /************************ The following code prints the contents of a relation directly to the output console.

Since we're currently only working with the relation and attribute catalog, we define the function as follows. Cache/OpenRelTable.cpp /* This function will open a relation having name `relName`. Since we are currently only working with the relation and attribute catalog, we will just hardcode it. In subsequent stages, we will loop through all the relations and open the appropriate one. */ int OpenRelTable::getRelId(char relName[ATTR_SIZE]) { // if relname is RELCAT_RELNAME, return RELCAT_RELID // if relname is ATTRCAT_RELNAME, return ATTRCAT_RELID return E_RELNOTOPEN; } And that's it!

NITCbase supports opening 12 relations at once. Since the relation catalog and attribute catalog are always open, we can only open 10 other relations. If we want to open any more relations, we will have to close some relation. Note that the NITCbase specification does not allow closing of the relation and attribute catalog unless at the time of database exit. NITCbase requires that a relation be opened before any DML commands can be performed on it. We discussed the RelCacheTable and AttrCacheTable classes in the preceding stage. Here, we introduce the class OpenRelTable. This class manages the opening and closing of relations and handles the caching operations. It has a member tableMetaInfo which is a MAX_OPEN sized array of type struct OpenRelTableMetaInfo. tableMetaInfo is used to store which entries of the caches are free and the relation to which an occupied entry belongs. For any index k that is occupied in the caches, the entries at index k in relCache, attrCache and tableMetaInfo will correspond to the same relation. Recall that this index k is called the relation's rel-id. These three tables comprise the core functionality of the Cache Layer of NITCbase. A table can be opened and closed by the user with the OPEN TABLE and CLOSE TABLE commands respectively, both handled by the Schema Layer.","s":"Open and Closed Relations","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage05","h":"#open-and-closed-relations","p":418},{"i":425,"t":"To open a relation, we need to search through the relation and attribute catalog and fetch the records corresponding to the relation we want to open. To search through the records of a relation, we require that it's catalog entries be present in the caches i.e the relation is open. Hence, NITCbase ensures that the relation catalog and attribute catalog are always kept open. A sequence diagrams documenting the flow of data between the layers is shown below. NOTE: The functions are denoted with circles as follows. 🔵 -> methods that are already in their final state 🟢 -> methods that will attain their final state in this stage 🟠 -> methods that we will modify in this stage, and in subsequent stages A class diagram showing the methods relevant to this functionality in the Cache Layer and Schema Layer is shown below. Note that we will be using functions from the Buffer Layer and the linearSearch function from the Block Access Layer that was already implemented by you in the earlier stages. However, these functions do not require any modification at this stage. Hence, their class diagrams are not included below. Schema Layer Cache Layer As shown in the sequence diagram above, the Frontend User Interface will parse the OPEN TABLE command and call the Frontend::open_table() function in the Frontend Programming Interface. This call is then transferred along to the Schema Layer. Hence, the implementation of the Frontend::open_table() function only involves a call to the Schema::openRel() function. Similarly, the CLOSE TABLE command leads to the Frontend::close_table() function which in turn transfers control to Schema::closeRel(). Frontend/Frontend.cpp int Frontend::open_table(char relname[ATTR_SIZE]) { return Schema::openRel(relname); } int Frontend::close_table(char relname[ATTR_SIZE]) { return Schema::closeRel(relname); } Now, let us implement the functions in the Schema Layer The Schema::openRel() function invokes the Cache Layer function OpenRelTable::openRel(). Schema::closeRel() closes a relation if it is open by calling OpenRelTable::closeRel() which frees that slot in the caches. Note that this function should not allow the closing of the relation catalog and the attribute catalog. Closing a relation involves writing back to the disk any changes that have been made to the relation while the relation was open. At this stage, we have not implemented any such update operations and hence, your current implementation of Schema::closeRel() does not need to handle the same. We will add this functionality in later stages. Schema/Schema.cpp int Schema::openRel(char relName[ATTR_SIZE]) { int ret = OpenRelTable::openRel(relName); // the OpenRelTable::openRel() function returns the rel-id if successful // a valid rel-id will be within the range 0 <= relId < MAX_OPEN and any // error codes will be negative if(ret >= 0){ return SUCCESS; } //otherwise it returns an error message return ret; } int Schema::closeRel(char relName[ATTR_SIZE]) { if (/* relation is relation catalog or attribute catalog */) { return E_NOTPERMITTED; } // this function returns the rel-id of a relation if it is open or // E_RELNOTOPEN if it is not. we will implement this later. int relId = OpenRelTable::getRelId(relName); if (/* relation is not open */) { return E_RELNOTOPEN; } return OpenRelTable::closeRel(relId); } Next, we implement the functions of the Cache Layer The OpenRelTable class will need to be modified to initialise and update the values in the tableMetaInfo array. We will also implement the functions for opening and closing relations. Note that tableMetaInfo is an array of type struct OpenRelTableMetaInfo. It is static member of the class and will hence need to be explicitly declared before it can be used.

We will obviously have to reuse an existing slot to load in our new block. NITCbase uses the LRU(least recently used) algorithm to decide on the block that will be replaced. Each entry in the buffer has a corresponding timestamp field which keeps track of how long it has been since the disk block buffered in that particular location has been used. When a position needs to be freed up, the disk block with the highest timestamp is chosen and changes, if any, are written back to the disk. Each entry in the buffer also has a corresponding dirty field which is a boolean value storing if the values in that buffer entry have been updated since they were loaded from the disk block.

Buffer Layer As shown in the sequence diagram above, the Frontend User Interface will parse the ALTER TABLE RENAME command and call the Frontend::alter_table_rename() function in the Frontend Programming Interface. This call is then transferred along to the Schema Layer. Hence, the implementation of the Frontend::alter_table_rename() function only involves a call to the Schema::renameRel() function. Similarly, the ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN command leads to the Frontend::alter_table_rename_column() function which in turn transfers control to Schema::renameAttr().

Both BlockBuffer and RecBuffer classes have two constructors each (referred to as Constructor1 and Constructor2). Thus, put together, these two classes have four constructors. When a disk block is allocated to a relation for the first time, Constructor1 of the RecBuffer class must be invoked. This function has no arguments, and in turn invokes the Constructor1 of BlockBuffer with argument 'R' (indicating that the allocated block is to be used as a record block and not an index block. Allocation of index blocks will be discussed in later stages of the roadmap.). Constructor1 of BlockBuffer will iterate through the block allocation map for an unallocated block and return a free block, if available. The number of the allocated block will be stored in the private data field blockNum of the object allocated. (IMPORTANT NOTE: If block allocation failed, appropriate error code will be written on to the blockNum field. Care should be taken to check whether the allocation was successful before going ahead with accessing the block!) Recall that we have already completed the implementation of RecBuffer::Constructor2 and BlockBuffer::Constructor2 in the previous stages. If a record block was already allocated to a relation using RecBuffer::Constructor1 in the past, then RecBuffer::Constructor2 is used for the subseqent access of the block. This constructor, as already seen, involves loading the block from the disk to the buffer (if not already present) and updating the data structures in the class StaticBuffer. Since the block number is already known in this case, it must be passed as an argument to the constructor. RecBuffer::Constructor2 in turn invokes the parent class constructor BlockBuffer::Constructor2, passing the block number as an argument, for performing the required functionality. NITCbase requires that the RecBuffer::Constructor1 be invoked only when both the conditions below hold true: a record is added into a relation (or when a new relation is created, resulting in an insertion into the catalogs) none of its already allocated blocks (if any) have a free slot to store the inserted record, implying that insertion cannot be performed without allocating a new block. In all the previous stages, such insertion was performed only through the XFS Interface, and we never had to do a fresh block allocation for any relation. In this stage, we will be implementing RecBuffer::Constructor1 and BlockBuffer::Constructor1 to support record insertions into existing relations. The methods relevant to adding this functionality are shown in the class diagram below.

This method makes use of the setHeader() method to set up the header in the newly acquired disk block and the setBlockType() method to update the type of the block in the block allocation map. Similar to other disk data structures, the block allocation map too is loaded into memory during the runtime of the database. In the StaticBuffer file, we declare the blockAllocMap member field and update our constructor and destructor to initialise and write-back the block alloc map between the disk and memory.

After we insert a record, this value will have to be incremented. This far, we have only been reading from the caches. In this stage, we will implement write-back for the relation cache. Similar to the buffer, each entry in the caches contain a dirty field which stores whether that entry has been modified. If a cache entry is dirty, it will need to be written back (to the copy of the disk block in the buffer) either when the relation is closed (with the CLOSE TABLE command) or at system exit when all open relations are closed. The cache entry can be written back to the disk buffer using an instance of the RecBuffer class. Our earlier implementation did not need to do this since we did not have any operations which modified the caches. A class diagram indicating the relevant methods in the Cache Layer is shown below. In earlier stages, we had implemented the RelCacheTable::getRelCatEntry() function to get an entry from the relation cache. In this stage, we will implement it's counterpart RelCacheTable::setRelCatEntry() which is how we update the values stored in the relation cache during runtime. We will also implement the RelCacheTable::relCatEntryToRecord() function which converts from the struct RelCatEntry to a relation catalog entry record.

Buffer Layer As shown in the sequence diagram above, the Frontend User Interface will parse the INSERT INTO TABLE VALUES command and call the Frontend::insert_into_table_values() function in the Frontend Programming Interface.

Frontend/Frontend.cpp int Frontend::insert_into_table_values(char relname[ATTR_SIZE], int attr_count, char attr_values[][ATTR_SIZE]) { return Algebra::insert(relname, attr_count, attr_values); } The Algebra::insert() function does some validation on the input and converts the user inputs, which are in the form of a string, and assigns it to an union Attribute type. It then calls the BlockAccess::insert() function to handle the insertion of the record. Algebra/Algebra.cpp Implement the Algebra::insert() function by looking at the design docs.

The Frontend Programming Interface handles the file input and repeatedly calls the Frontend::insert_into_table_values() function that you implemented. caution While inserting the records, the number of records is updated in the relation cache. However, if we were to immediately run the SELECT command to read the values stored in the relation catalog, we will find that the #Records field is not up to date. This is because while the relation is open, all the updates made to the catalog relations are only present in the respective caches. It is only when the relation is closed that the changes are written to the buffer (and subsequently the disk). If we were to close the relation and then read the records of the relation catalog, we would see that the updated #Records value is indeed reflected in the record. Though this is an inconsistency in the values, all runtime operations only make use of the values in the caches and do not read from the disk.

This functionality is implemented in the Schema Layer and the Block Access Layer, and is called using the CREATE TABLE command. Deleting a relation is done using the DROP TABLE command. This process involves freeing all the blocks used to store the record of the relation and removing all the records corresponding to the relation from the catalogs.

Cache Layer Buffer Layer As shown in the sequence diagram above, the Frontend User Interface will parse the CREATE TABLE command and call the Frontend::create_table() function in the Frontend Programming Interface. This call is then transferred along to the Schema Layer. Hence, the implementation of the Frontend::create_table() function only involves a call to the Schema::createRel() function. Similarly, the DROP TABLE command leads to the Frontend::drop_table() function which in turn transfers control to Schema::deleteRel(). Frontend/Frontend.cpp int Frontend::create_table(char relname[ATTR_SIZE], int no_attrs, char attributes[][ATTR_SIZE], int type_attrs[]) { return Schema::createRel(relname, no_attrs, attributes, type_attrs); } int Frontend::drop_table(char relname[ATTR_SIZE]) { return Schema::deleteRel(relname); } Now, let us implement the functions in the Schema Layer. The Schema::createRel() function is used to create a relation. Creating a relation involves adding the relevant records to the relation catalog and the attribute catalog (using BlockAccess::insert()). Before this can be done, the user input will need to be verified to ensure that there are no existing relations with the same name. Additionally, it will also need to be verified that the new relation does not contain duplicate attribute names. The Schema::deleteRel() is used to delete a relation. NITCbase requires that a relation be closed before it is deleted. This is to avoid inconsistencies between the buffer and the disk. Deleting a relation is done with a call to the BlockAccess::deleteRelation() function (we will implement this function later in this stage). Schema/Schema.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs Schema::createRel() Schema::deleteRel() Recall that every open relation has an entry in the relation cache. If any update to the cache entries for a relation are made, these must be committed back to the disk. Normally, such write-back is performed when the relation is closed. Hence, in the previous stages, we implemented the write-back operations in the OpenRelTable::closeRel() function. However, in the present stage, when we create a new relation, the relation cache entries for the relation catalog and attribute catalog will be modified (the numRecords field will be incremented). Since these catalogs are never opened or closed, the relation cache write-back cannot happen inside OpenReltable::closeRel(). Instead, the relation cache write-back for the relation catalog and the attirbute catalog is peformed when the destructor for the OpenRelTable class is executed during system shutdown. (Recall that the cache entries for relation catalog and attribute catalog were set up during system initialization, when the constructor for OpenRelTable executed). Cache/OpenRelTable.cpp Implement the OpenRelTable::~OpenRelTable() function by looking at the design docs. In the Buffer Layer, we implement the BlockBuffer::releaseBlock() function which takes a block number as an argument and frees that block in the buffer and the block allocation map, thus making the block available for use again. WARNING The low level disk operations on all disk blocks are performed by the StaticBuffer class and the BlockBuffer class. However, NITCBase design does not permit higher layer functions to perform any modifications on blocks directly by accessing the buffer. Instead, the following access procedure is stipulated by the design. Whenever a higher layer class requires a block to be accessed or created, it must first create an object of the BlockBuffer class. This operation associates a block (either existing or new) to the new BlockBuffer object. All further operations on the block must be performed using calls to appropriate methods of the BlockBuffer object. (The only exception to this rule is the StaticBuffer::getStaticBlockType() function, which may be directly invoked by higher layer functions.) Now, if a higher layer function wishes to release a block allocated to a relation, the BlockBuffer::releaseBlock() function may be invoked. This function updates the disk data structures to mark the block as free and disassociates the BlockBuffer object from the disk block by setting block number field of the BlockBuffer object as INVALID_BLK. It is important to note here that such release operations creates a situation where the BlockBuffer object is no longer associated with any valid disk block, and any further access to the functions of the object will result in the return of an error code. Hence, care must be exercised in higher layer functions to avoid implementation errors due to attempts to access BlockBuffer objects that have already been released. Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp Implement the BlockBuffer::releaseBlock() function by looking at the design docs. In the Block Access Layer, we implement the search() function and the deleteRelation() function. We do not need to modify the Block Access Layer for relation creation at this stage because creation of a relation only involves insertion of records into the catalogs and this is something that we had already implemented in previous stages (in the insert() function). However, this function will be updated in subsequent stages to handle indexing. The search() function in it's final state will be used to either do a linear search or a B+ tree search on the records of a relation depending on whether an index exists for the relation. Since we have not implemented indexes yet, our current implementation will just call the linearSearch() function. The deleteRelation() function releases all the record blocks of the relation and deletes the relation's entries from the relation and attribute catalog. If the deletion of the entries in the attribute catalog causes one of its blocks to be completely unoccupied, we release that block as well. We then update the changes in the records of the catalogs in the catalog caches. BlockAccess/BlockAccess.cpp /* NOTE: This function will copy the result of the search to the `record` argument. The caller should ensure that space is allocated for `record` array based on the number of attributes in the relation. */ int BlockAccess::search(int relId, Attribute *record, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE], Attribute attrVal, int op) { // Declare a variable called recid to store the searched record RecId recId; /* search for the record id (recid) corresponding to the attribute with attribute name attrName, with value attrval and satisfying the condition op using linearSearch() */ // if there's no record satisfying the given condition (recId = {-1, -1}) // return E_NOTFOUND; /* Copy the record with record id (recId) to the record buffer (record) For this Instantiate a RecBuffer class object using recId and call the appropriate method to fetch the record */ return SUCCESS; } TASK: Implement the BlockAccess::deleteRelation() method by looking at the design docs. The algorithm specified in the docs calls BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy() to free any indexes that exist for the relation. Since we have not yet implemented indexing, this call may be omitted. Except for the variables, constants, and methods referring to indexing, the rest of the design remains the same. Your NITCbase now supports the creation of relations.

In this stage, we will complete the implementation of the select operation and the project operation. As discussed earlier, a SELECT operation in relational algebra involves fetching all the records that satisfy a given condition. Our previous implementation would select records from a relation and print them to the console. The actual NITCbase specification defines the SELECT operation as selecting records from a relation that satisfy a specific condition and writing those records into a newly created relation of a specified name. Since we have now implemented relation creation, we can finish our implementation of the SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE command. A PROJECT operation on a relation is used to pick a subset of columns from the relation. In NITCbase, doing a PROJECT operation on a relation would result in the creation of a new relation with a subset of the attributes of the source relation. The required attributes will be picked from each record and inserted into the new relation.

In the Block Access Layer, we implement the project() function. This function is used to fetch one record of the relation. Each subsequent call would return the next record until there are no more records to be returned. Similar to the linearSearch() function you implemented earlier, project() makes use of the searchIndex in the relation cache to keep track of the last NOTE: Even though this function is named project(), it does not do a PROJECT operation. It effectively serves as a way to access the next record from a relation. The actual projection of the record to a subset of its columns is implemented in the Algebra Layer. This function is named project() only due to the fact that it serves as a helper function for the Algebra::project() function. BlockAccess/BlockAccess.cpp Implement the BlockAccess::project() function by looking at the algorithm given in the design docs. In the Algebra Layer, you had already implemented part of the select() function in previous stages. In this stage, you will modify the function to create a new relation and insert the selected records into the new relation. We also add two new overloaded functions project(srcRel, targetRel) and project(srcRel, targetRel, numAttrs, attrs) which are responsible for the SELECT * FROM TABLE and SELECT AttrList FROM TABLE commands respectively. The SELECT AttrList FROM TABLE WHERE also makes use of the project(srcRel, targetRel, numAttrs, attrs) function. Note that the project(srcRel, targetRel) function is used to create a copy of the source relation into the target relation. Algebra/Algebra.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs Algebra::select(). NOTE: The definition of the above function involves a call to the AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex() function before the call to the BlockAccess::search() function. This call is only relevant when we are doing a B+ tree search. Since we have not yet implemented indexing, this call can be omitted. The rest of the design remains the same. Algebra::project(srcRel, targetRel) Algebra::project(srcRel, targetRel, numAttrs, attrs) Finally, in the Frontend Programming Interface, we update the handlers of the functions to call the respective Algebra Layer methods. Contrary to what we are used to, the implementation of the Frontend::select_attrlist_from_table_where() function involves more than just a call to a lower layer method.

An index would help us to traverse these disk blocks much quicker than a linear search over every record. If we find ourselves frequently doing search operations on the values of one specific attribute of the relation, then creating an index on that attribute will immensely speed up the search. For example, consider the relation Student having 5 attributes (Roll No, Name, Marks, Grade, Attendance). As an administrator, we might have to frequently get the subset of students having Marks greater than some amount M. Instead of going through each and every record and checking if it satisfies our condition, the index allows us to easily reach the first record with Marks > M. We know that in a B+ tree, every subsequent leaf node will also satisfy this condition (Why?). You can see how this would save us a lot of time. In NITCbase, indexes are B+ trees with internal nodes of size 100, and leaf nodes of size 63. Each of these nodes will be stored in a separate disk block. A fully filled internal node would consist of a 100 attribute values from various records and 101 pointers to their respective children. A pointer here refers to the block number of the corresponding internal or leaf index block. A fully filled leaf node would consist of 63 attribute values from various records. For each of these attribute values, the block number and slot number of the record with this value is also stored. The attribute catalog stores whether a particular attribute of a relation has an index. If it does, the RootBlock field of the attribute catalog will store the block number of the root block of the index. If not, RootBlock will contain the value -1. To proceed further, we will need some prerequisite reading. PREREQUISITE READING internal index blocks leaf index blocks A production database might automatically create and dispose of indexes as required by the program without user intervention. In NITCbase, the user is expected to decide when the index is to be created and dropped (using the CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX commands of the Schema Layer). Note that we will not be implementing these commands in the present stage and will instead be using them through the XFS Interface. Q. Assume that we have an empty database with no relations. We start it and create a table LibraryBooks(name STR, id NUM, shelf NUM, borrower STR). We then insert 1000 records into the relation LibraryBooks in descending order of their id. It is given that the records have id from 1000 to 1. If we were to do a search for a book with id > 500, which book would we get? What's the corresponding record-id=(block, slot)? We then create an index on id for LibraryBooks. How many index blocks would be created? How many entries does the root block have? What is the rightmost value in the root node of the B+ tree? If we were to again do a search for a book with id > 500, which book would we get? What is the index of the entry corresponding to the found record in the leaf node of the B+ tree? (click to view answer) Answer We will get the record with id=1000 because that's the first record that will satisfy the condition when a linear search is done. Since this record will be the first relation in the first block of the relation, we get that the rec-id is {6, 1}. There will be 31 leaf index blocks and 1 internal index block. The root block will have 30 entries. The rightmost value in the node will be 968/969 depending on the implementation. We would get the book with id 501 because the records will be sorted in ascending order in the leaf node. A B+ search will return the first node in the leaf that satisfies the condition.","s":"Introduction","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage10","h":"#introduction","p":467},{"i":472,"t":"In this stage, you will implement the B+ search operations on a relation in the BPlusTree::bPlusSearch() function. We will also modify the functions we designed earlier to do an indexed search if an index is available. Similar to the linear search operation that you implemented in the Block Access Layer, the BPlusTree::bPlusSearch() function, when called for the first time, will return the first record that satisfies the given condition. Every subsequent call to the function will return a proceeding record that satisfies the condition until there are no more records to be returned. Recall that in BlockAccess::linearSearch(), the position of the previously returned record was stored in the RelCacheTable in the searchIndex field of the entry corresponding to the relation. This field was used to keep track of the position while searching through the records. To restart a search from the beginning, we would have to reset the search index using the RelCacheTable::resetSearchIndex() function. The BPlusTree::bPlusSearch() function too makes use of a searchIndex field to keep track of it's previous search position in the leaf of the B+ tree. For a B+ search on the B+ tree of an attribute, the search index is stored in the linked list entry corresponding to the attribute in the AttrCacheTable entry of the relation. The search index can be reset using the AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex() function. Unlike the search index in the relation cache, this search index does not store the rec-id of the record (from the linear search). Here, the search index stores the last entry in the leaf of the B+ tree that matched our search (that is, the block number and the entry within the leaf index block). To proceed further, you will need to read the documentation explaining how indexing is implemented in NITCbase. While the earlier documentation explained the algorithms of the B+ tree data structure, the following document explains the specific implementation details of this data structure in NITCbase. PREREQUISITE READING Indexing in NITCbase To add the B+ tree search functionality, we will need to implement the following: The Buffer Layer methods to read from index blocks. Here, we introduce three new classes IndBuffer, IndInternal and IndLeaf. IndBuffer is an abstract class which defines virtual methods to access and update entries in index blocks. Note that IndBuffer cannot be instantiated owing to it being abstract. IndInternal and IndLeaf are children of IndBuffer used for buffered access to leaf blocks and internal index blocks respectively of the B+ tree. The Cache Layer methods to read and update the search index in the attribute cache The B+ Tree Layer method to search through a B+ tree present in the disk Modifications to the Block Access Layer to call the B+ search if an index is present Modifications to the Algebra Layer to reset the search index in the attribute cache before beginning B+ search A sequence diagram documenting the call sequence for a call to the BlockAccess::search() function is shown below. NOTE: The functions are denoted with circles as follows. 🔵 -> methods that are already in their final state 🟢 -> methods that will attain their final state in this stage 🟤 -> methods that we built earlier and require more work later, but will leave as is in this stage A class diagram showing all the relevant methods is given below. Note that the Buffer Layer classes corresponding to record blocks have been omitted for the sake of brevity. Cache Layer Buffer Layer When an index is created on an attribute of a relation, the attribute catalog entry of the attribute is updated to store the block number of the root block of the B+ tree on the disk. This may be a leaf index block or an internal index block. Recall that the search() function in the Block Access Layer is used to either do a B+ search or a linear search depending on the presence of an index. Our earlier implementation did not account for indexes and directly called the BlockAccess:linearSearch() function. We now modify that function to check the attribute catalog entry and call the BPlusTree::bPlusSearch() function if there is an index (we will implement this function later in this stage). BlockAccess/BlockAccess.cpp Implement the BlockAccess::search() function by looking at the design docs. In the Cache Layer, we add the methods to work with the search index in the attribute cache similar to what we had implemented for the search index in the relation cache. We have methods AttrCacheTable::getSearchIndex(), AttrCacheTable::setSearchIndex() and AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex(). Note that each of these methods are overloaded to identify an attribute with either the attribute name or attribute offset. Thus, we have a total of 6 functions to implement in the AttrCacheTable class. Cache/AttrCacheTable.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs AttrCacheTable::getSearchIndex(relId, attrName, searchIndex*) AttrCacheTable::getSearchIndex(relId, attrOffset, searchIndex*) AttrCacheTable::setSearchIndex(relId, attrName, searchIndex*) AttrCacheTable::setSearchIndex(relId, attrOffset, searchIndex*) AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex(relId, attrName, searchIndex*) AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex(relId, attrOffset, searchIndex*) We had earlier modified BlockAccess::search() such that it can do either a linear search or a B+ search. Recall that in our current implementation, we always reset the search index in the relation cache before the first call to linearSearch() or search() to start searching from the beginning. It is now needed to modify the design to reset the search index in the attribute cache before the first call to bPlusSearch() or search(). Thus far in our implementation, BlockAccess::search() has only been used in the select() function in the Algebra Layer. So, we modify our earlier design to call AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex() before the first call to search(). Algebra/Algebra.cpp Implement the Algebra::select() function by looking at the design docs. In the Buffer Layer, we implement the methods to read from index blocks using classes IndInternal and IndLeaf as mentioned earlier. Similar to how we've used RecBuffer to read from record blocks thus far, the IndBuffer class defines virtual methods getEntry() and setEntry() to access the entry at a particular index in a B+ tree node. Note that every node of the B+ tree occupies an entire block of the XFS disk. The IndInternal and IndLeaf classes also define a constructor 1(which is used to read from an already allocated index block) and a constructor 2 (which is used to allocate a new index block) similar to what we had implemented for RecBuffer. These constructors call their parent class IndBuffer's constructor 1 and constructor 2 respectively which in turn calls the corresponding BlockBuffer constructors that we implemented earlier. Similar to the struct Attribute that we used to hold the values in a record, we have helper structs to store index entries as well. An entry from a leaf index block is represented using struct Index and an entry from an internal index block is represented using struct InternalEntry. Since we do not need to modify indexes at this stage, we will only be implementing the getEntry() method. We will also define an empty setEntry() method to avoid compilation issues. Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp Implement the following constructors looking at the respective design docs IndBuffer::Constructor1 IndInternal::Constructor1 IndLeaf::Constructor1 IndBuffer::Constructor2 IndInternal::Constructor2 IndLeaf::Constructor2 Implement the following functions looking at the respective design docs IndInternal::getEntry() IndLeaf::getEntry() Add the following empty definitions to avoid compilation issues. We will implement these function in later stages. int IndInternal::setEntry(void *ptr, int indexNum) { return 0; } int IndLeaf::setEntry(void *ptr, int indexNum) { return 0; } An additional function we will need in the Buffer Layer is the StaticBuffer::getStaticBlockType() function which takes a block number and returns the type of the block (REC/IND_INTERNAL/IND_LEAF/UNUSED_BLK). We will use this function when we implement bPlusSearch() later in this stage. Buffer/StaticBuffer.cpp Implement the StaticBuffer::getStaticBlockType() function by looking at the design docs. Lastly, we implement the B+ Tree Layer function bPlusSearch() which comprises all the logic for an indexed search operation. Refer to the algorithm for search if you have not done so already.

Buffer/BlockBuffer.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs IndLeaf::setEntry() IndInternal::setEntry()","s":"Writing to Index Blocks","u":"/docs/Roadmap/Stage11","h":"#writing-to-index-blocks","p":474},{"i":485,"t":"In the B+ Tree Layer, we implement methods to create a B+ tree, insert into a B+ tree and free all the index blocks associated with a B+ tree. Note that we do not need to implement the functionality to delete an individual entry from a B+ tree (why?). A class diagram highlighting all the functions that will be modified to implement this functionality is shown below. As shown in the sequence diagram above, the Frontend User Interface will parse the CREATE INDEX command and call the Frontend::create_index() function in the Frontend Programming Interface. This call is then transferred along to the Schema Layer. Hence, the implementation of the Frontend::create_index() function only involves a call to the Schema::createIndex() function. Similarly, the DROP INDEX command leads to the Frontend::drop_index() function which in turn transfers control to Schema::dropIndex(). Frontend/Frontend.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs Frontend::create_index() Frontend::drop_index() The Schema::createIndex() function verifies that the relation is open and passes the rel-id and attribute name along to the BPlusTree::bPlusCreate() function to create an index (to be implemented later in this stage). The Schema::deleteIndex() function fetches the root block of the index on a specified attribute from the attribute cache and then calls the BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy() function to free the index blocks. The corresponding attribute cache entry is then updated to indicate that there no longer exists a B+ tree on the attribute. Schema/Schema.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs Schema::createIndex() Schema::dropIndex() We implement the core functionality of this stage in the B+ Tree Layer. The BPlusTree::bPlusCreate() is used to create an index on attribute for a relation. It allocates a new index block and sets the RootBlock field in the corresponding attribute cache entry. It then reads every record of the relation and inserts the attribute value into the index using BPlusTree::bPlusInsert(). The BPlusTree::bPlusInsert() function is used to insert an entry into the B+ tree of an attribute. It gets the root block of the corresponding tree from the attribute cache and then traverses the tree until the appropriate leaf block is found. If the insertion leads to the splitting of the root block (and hence the creation of a new root block), then this function updates the attribute cache with the new root block. The BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy() function recursively traverses all the blocks of the index and frees them using BlockBuffer::releaseBlock(). BPlusTree/BPlusTree.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs BPlusTree::bPlusCreate() BPlusTree::bPlusInsert() BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy() Lastly, in the Block Access Layer, we update the insert() method to insert the new record into any existing indexes of the relation using BPlusTree::bPlusInsert(). The deleteRelation() method is updated to free up any indexes associated with the relation by calling BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy(). BlockAccess/BlockAccess.cpp Implement the following functions looking at their respective design docs BlockAccess::insert() BlockAccess::deleteRelation() And with that, your NITCbase now supports the creation and deletion of indexes!
