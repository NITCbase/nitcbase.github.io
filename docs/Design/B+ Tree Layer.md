The B+ Tree Layer code is to be written in `BPlusTree.cpp` and it's header file `BPlusTree.h`

[**The stub code for these files can be found here.**](/stub/bplus_stub)

## Layout

Indexing is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. It reduces the number of disk accesses needed when a search query is processed. NITCbase uses B+ Trees for the purpose of indexing an attribute in a relation. The B+ Tree Layer provides specifications for the creation/ usage of B+ Trees.

For each internal entry in the B+ tree, the attribute values in the left child are smaller or equal to, and the attribute values in the right child are larger than the attribute value of its parent. This property allows systematic traversal of the B+ Tree. <br/>
The leaf entries are ordered in ascending order of attribute values. The Leaf Index blocks are also connected as a linked list. This allows easy access to an entry in the next Leaf Index block rather than traversing the entire B+ Tree from the root to reach that entry.

NITCbase follows Object Oriented design for implementing B+ Tree. The class diagram is as shown below.

## class BPlusTree

```cpp
class BPlusTree {
public:
    static int bPlusCreate(int relId, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE]);
    static int bPlusInsert(int relId, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE], union Attribute attrVal, RecId recordId);
    static RecId bPlusSearch(int relId, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE], union Attribute attrVal, int op);
    static int bPlusDestroy(int rootBlockNum);
};

```

## bPlusCreate

#### Description

This method creates a B+ Tree (Indexing) for the input attribute of the specified relation. It inserts the attribute value corresponding to attrName of all entries in the relation into the B+Tree using [bPlusInsert()](#bplusinsert).<br/>
If in between the insertion, the disk runs out of space, then the B+ Tree will not be created.

#### Arguments

| **Attribute** | **Type**          | **Description**                                                             |

| attrName      | `char[ATTR_SIZE]` | Attribute/column name for which B+ tree (index) is to be created.           |

#### Return values

## bPlusInsert

#### Description

Inserts an Index entry corresponding to the input attribute value and record id into the B+ tree.

:::info NOTE

During insertion of an entry to a valid B+ Tree, the disk may run out of memory. In such a case, the existing B+ Tree will be destroyed and the attribute catalog entry for the attribute will have rootBlock set to -1. Any operation on the B+ Tree must ensure that the object instance has a valid rootBlock.

## bPlusSearch

#### Description

Used to search the first/ next record entry in the relation whose attribute value corresponding to `attrName` satisfies the relational operation for the input attribute value. <br/>
The method makes use of the searchIndex field of the attribute in the Attribute Catalog Cache for this purpose. A valid index id holds the index id of the entry in the leaf block of the B+ Tree that corresponded to a hit in the previous search. The search is resumed from the next index entry. An invalid index id means that the search is being done for the first time. <br/>
This method can be called multiple times to get all the records in the relation that satisfy op for input attrVal.

:::info NOTE

The caller is expected to verify that an index exists on attrName for the relation. {-1, -1} will be returned otherwise.

## bPlusDestroy

#### Description

Used to delete a B+ Tree. The caller passes the root block of the B+ Tree as input to the method. The method recursively deletes the constituent index blocks, both internal and leaf index blocks, until the full B+ Tree is deleted.

This method is called in a situation where no further disk blocks can be allotted during the creation of/ insertion to a B+ Tree. This function is also called while deleting an entire relation in NITCbase.

:::info NOTE

The caller is responsible for updating the rootBlock field in the corresponding attribute catalog after deletion.

:::

#### Arguments

| **Attribute** | **Type** | **Description**                                         |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| rootBlockNum  | `int`    | block number of the root of the B+ tree to be destroyed |

#### Return values

| **Value**                      | **Description**                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`SUCCESS`](/constants)        | On successful deletion of the B+ tree rooted at rootBlockNum  |
| [`E_OUTOFBOUND`](/constants)   | if `rootBlockNum` is outside the valid range of block numbers |
| [`E_INVALIDBLOCK`](/constants) | if `rootBlockNum` does not correspond to an index block       |

#### Algorithm

```cpp
int BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy(int rootBlockNum) {
    if (/*rootBlockNum lies outside the valid range [0,DISK_BLOCKS-1]*/) {
        return E_OUTOFBOUND;
    }

    // store the type of block having using StaticBuffer::getStaticBlockType()
    int type;

    if (type == IND_LEAF) {
        // let leafBlk be used to hold block of rootBlockNum using IndLeaf::IndLeaf().
        IndLeaf leafBlk(rootBlockNum);

        // release the block using BlockBuffer::releaseBlock().

        return SUCCESS;

    } else if (type == IND_INTERNAL) {
        // let internalBlk be used to hold block of blockNum using IndInternal::IndInternal().
        IndInternal internalBlk(rootBlockNum);

        // let internalHead be used to store header of internalBlk.
        HeadInfo internalHead;

        // load the header using BlockBuffer::getHeader().

        // let entry be used to hold an entry of the internalBlk.
        InternalEntry entry;

        /*iterate through all the entries of the internalBlk and destroy the lChild
        of the first entry and rChild of all entries using BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy().
        (take care not to delete overlapping children more than once)*/

        // release the block using BlockBuffer::releaseBlock().

        return SUCCESS;

    } else {
