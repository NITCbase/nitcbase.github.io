## Layout

Indexing is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. It reduces the number of disk accesses needed when a search query is processed. NITCbase uses B+ Trees for the purpose of indexing an attribute in a relation. The B+ Tree Layer provides specifications for the creation/ usage of B+ Trees.

For each internal entry in the B+ tree, the attribute values in the left child are smaller or equal to, and the attribute values in the right child are larger than the attribute value of its parent. This property allows systematic traversal of the B+ Tree. <br/>
The leaf entries are ordered in ascending order of attribute values. The Leaf Index blocks are also connected as a linked list. This allows easy access to an entry in the next Leaf Index block rather than traversing the entire B+ Tree from the root to reach that entry.

NITCbase follows Object Oriented design for implementing B+ Tree. The class diagram is as shown below.

### BPlusTree::bPlusCreate

#### Description

This method creates a B+ Tree (Indexing) for the input attribute of the specified relation. It inserts the attribute value corresponding to attrName of all entries in the relation into the B+Tree using [bPlusInsert()](#bplusinsert).<br/>
If in between the insertion, the disk runs out of space, then the B+ Tree will not be created.

#### Arguments

| **Name** | **Type**          | **Description**                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| relId    | `int`             | Relation Id of the relation whose attribute a B+ tree is to be created for. |
| attrName | `char[ATTR_SIZE]` | Attribute/column name for which B+ tree (index) is to be created.           |

#### Return values

### BPlusTree::bPlusSearch

#### Description

This method searches the relation specified using a B+ tree to find the next record that satisfies the specified condition. The condition value is given by the argument `attrVal`. This function returns the recId of the next record satisfying the condition. The condition that is checked for is the following.

```
value-in-record `op` attrVal
```

:::info note

- This function reads the "next" record from the given relation that satisfies a given condition. The search index of the attribute (stored in the [AttrCacheTable](Cache%20Layer/AttrCacheTable.md) entry of the relation) is used to identify the location of the previous record that was returned. This function reads the next record and updates the value of the search index to the position of the newly read record, before passing the record to the caller.

- If `searchIndex` was reset to `{-1,-1}` before the call, this function starts reading from the beginning and returns the first record of the relation that satisfies the condition. The `AttrCacheTable::resetSearchIndex()` function may be used to reset the value of the search index.

- If the `searchIndex` value of a relation corresponds to the last record of the relation that satisfies the condition, this function will return `{-1, -1}`, as there is no "next" record to be read.

- If `searchIndex` has reached the last record of the relation, it is the responsibility of the caller to reset the search index if it is required that the function starts reading from the beginning of the relation again. If not done, every subsequent call to this function will return `{-1, -1}`.

### BPlusTree::bPlusDestroy

#### Description

Used to delete a B+ Tree rooted at a particular block passed as input to the method. The method recursively deletes the constituent index blocks, both internal and leaf index blocks, until the full B+ Tree is deleted.

This function is called when

- the user issues the `DROP INDEX` command
- in a situation where no further disk blocks can be allotted during the creation of/insertion to a B+ Tree
- while deleting an entire relation in NITCbase.

:::info NOTE

The caller is responsible for updating the rootBlock field in the corresponding attribute catalog after deletion.

### BPlusTree::bPlusInsert

#### Description

Inserts an attribute value and the rec-id of the corresponding record into a B+ tree index on the disk

:::info NOTE

During insertion of an entry to a valid B+ Tree, the disk may run out of memory. In such a case, the existing B+ Tree will be destroyed and the attribute catalog entry for the attribute will have rootBlock set to -1. Any operation on the B+ Tree must ensure that the object instance has a valid rootBlock.

:::caution

The caller is expected to ensure that

- the `RecId` passed belongs to a valid record in the same relation
- a duplicate index entry for this record does not already exist in the B+ tree.
- `recId` actually points to the specific record that the argument attribute value belongs to

This function will add the pair `(attrVal, recId)` to the B+ tree **without any validation** on these arguments.

#### Algorithm

```cpp
int BPlusTree::bPlusInsert(int relId, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE], Attribute attrVal, RecId recId) {
    // get the attribute cache entry corresponding to attrName
    // using AttrCacheTable::getAttrCatEntry().

    // if getAttrCatEntry() failed
    //     return the error code

    int blockNum = /* rootBlock of B+ Tree (from attrCatEntry) */;

    if (/* there is no index on attribute (rootBlock is -1) */) {

    }

    // find the leaf block to which insertion is to be done using the
    // findLeafToInsert() function

    // declare a struct Index with attrVal = attrVal, block = recId.block and
    // slot = recId.slot to pass as argument to the function.
    // insertIntoLeaf(relId, attrName, leafBlkNum, Index entry)
    // NOTE: the insertIntoLeaf() function will propagate the insertion to the
    //       required internal nodes by calling the required helper functions
    //       like insertIntoInternal() or createNewRoot()

    if (/*insertIntoLeaf() returns E_DISKFULL */) {

### BPlusTree::findLeafToInsert

#### Description

Used to find the leaf index block to which an attribute would be inserted to in the B+ insertion process. If this leaf turns out to be full, the caller will need to handle the splitting of this block to insert the entry.

:::note
According to the NITCbase specification, this function will only be called from [bPlusInsert()](#bplustreebplusinsert).

:::

:::caution

This function does not do any validation. It is the responsibility of the the caller to verify that

- the argument passed is the block number of root block of a B+ tree on the disk
- the attribute type that is present in the index matches the attribute type that is passed

Used to update the root of an existing B+ tree when the previous root block was split. This function will allocate a new root block and update the attribute cache entry of the attribute in the specified relation to point to the new root block.

:::note
According to the NITCbase specification, this function can only be called from either the [insertIntoLeaf()](#bplustreeinsertintoleaf) function or from the [insertIntoInternal()](#bplustreeinsertintointernal) function.

#### Arguments

| **Name** | **Type**          | **Description**                                                                                          |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| relId    | `int`             | Relation Id of the relation containing the attribute.                                                    |
| attrName | `char[ATTR_SIZE]` | Attribute/column name of the relation with given rel-id to whose B+ tree (index) an entry is to be added |
| attrVal  | `union Attribute` | Attribute value that needs to be inserted into the root block                                            |
| lChild   | `int`             | The block number of the left child of the new entry in the root block                                    |
| rChild   | `int`             | The block number of the right child of the new entry in the root block                                   |

#### Return values

| **Value**                       | **Description**                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`SUCCESS`](/docs/constants)    | On successful insertion into the B+ tree of the attribute      |
| [`E_DISKFULL`](/docs/constants) | If disk space is not sufficient for insertion into the B+ tree |

:::caution
The caller is expected to ensure that

- `relId` corresponds to an open relation
- `attrName` corresponds to the attribute of the specified relation whose index needs to be re-rooted.
- `attrVal` is of the same type as the attribute of the relation
- `lChild` and `rChild` correspond to the blocks that resulted from the split of the previous root block.

This function will update the root of the B+ tree **without any validation** on the arguments.

#### Algorithm

```cpp
int BPlusTree::createNewRoot(int relId, char attrName[ATTR_SIZE], Attribute attrVal, int lChild, int rChild) {
    // get the attribute cache entry corresponding to attrName
    // using AttrCacheTable::getAttrCatEntry().

    // declare newRootBlk, an instance of IndInternal using appropriate constructor
    // to allocate a new internal index block on the disk

    int newRootBlkNum = /* block number of newRootBlk */;

    if (newRootBlkNum == E_DISKFULL) {
        // (failed to obtain an empty internal index block because the disk is full)

        // Using bPlusDestroy(), destroy the right subtree, rooted at rChild.
        // This corresponds to the tree built up till now that has not yet been
        // connected to the existing B+ Tree

        return E_DISKFULL;
    }

    // update the header of the new block with numEntries = 1 using
    // BlockBuffer::getHeader() and BlockBuffer::setHeader()

    // create a struct InternalEntry with lChild, attrVal and rChild from the
    // arguments and set it as the first entry in newRootBlk using IndInternal::setEntry()

    // declare BlockBuffer instances for the `lChild` and `rChild` blocks using
    // appropriate constructor and update the pblock of those blocks to `newRootBlkNum`
    // using BlockBuffer::getHeader() and BlockBuffer::setHeader()

    // update rootBlock = newRootBlkNum for the entry corresponding to `attrName`
    // in the attribute cache using AttrCacheTable::setAttrCatEntry().

    return SUCCESS;
}
```
