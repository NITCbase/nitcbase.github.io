XFS Interface is an external command-line interface to access the NITCBase filesystem from the host (UNIX) system.
The filesystem is simulated on a binary file (`disk`). This interface aims to provide the functionality of **formatting and initializing the disk and transferring relations from/to the host system to/from the disk**. This is helpful in debugging the system during its implementation.

There are **four** types of commands supported by the XFS interface:

1. [Data Definition Language(DDL) Commands ](../NITCbase_Commands#data-definition-language-commands)
2. [Data Manipulation Language(DML) Commands](../NITCbase_Commands#data-manipulation-language-commands)
3. [XFS / External File System Commands](../NITCbase_Commands#external-file-system-xfs-commands)
4. [Script Commands](../NITCbase_Commands#script-commands)

**XFS interface has been implemented completely and provided to you**. It is available in the `XFS_Interface` directory. Feel free to follow the [installation guidelines provided here](./Installation%20Guidelines.md) and familiarize yourself with the commands. Refer to the [NITCbase Commands section](../NITCbase_Commands) to get the specifications for each commmand.
