This roadmap is divided into stages. Each stage is to be done in sequential order. From [Stage 2](./Stage2.md), you will build NITCbase incrementally. Links are provided throughout the document for further reference. There are two kinds of links. The contents of the important links must be read immediately before proceeding with the roadmap. The informative links may be clicked for more information about a particular concept. However this information may not be necessary at that point and you may proceed with the roadmap without visiting these links.

_It is very important that you proceed with the roadmap on a regular schedule and not get lost in the links_. Hence, an approximate amount of time (in hours) which you are expected to spend on each stage is noted along with the stage. If you find that reading a particular documentation/link takes too much time, skip it for the time being and come back to it only when needed.

This page is under costruction. Stages will be added shortly.
