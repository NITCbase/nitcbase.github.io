NITCbase supports two user interfaces namely, [XFS Interface](../XfS%20Interface/introduction.md) and [Frontend Interface](../Frontend%20Programming%20Interface/introduction.md). The commands supported by the two interfaces have overlap and they fall into the following **four** categories:
1. [Script Commands](../User%20Interface%20Commands/script-cmds.md)
2. [XFS / External File System Commands](../User%20Interface%20Commands/efs.md)
3. [Data Definition Language(DDL) Commands ](../User%20Interface%20Commands/ddl.md)
4. [Data Manipulation Language(DML) Commands](../User%20Interface%20Commands/dml.md)
